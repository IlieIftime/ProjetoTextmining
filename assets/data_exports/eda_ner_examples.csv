"Device Usage and Its Impact on Students’ Academic Performance

In today’s world, technology has become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones to laptops and tablets, devices have become a necessity for many people. However, the use of devices in the classroom has become a topic of debate in recent years. Some argue that the presence of devices can help students to learn and engage more effectively, while others argue that it can distract them and lead to decreased academic performance.

Research has shown that the use of devices in the classroom can have both positive and negative effects on students’ academic performance. On one hand, devices can provide students with access to a wealth of information and resources, allowing them to learn and engage more effectively. On the other hand, devices can be a source of distraction, with students using them to browse social media, play games, or watch videos instead of focusing on the lesson.

There are many schools around the world that have implemented policies related to device usage in the classroom. Some schools have banned devices altogether, while others have allowed them with certain restrictions. For example, some schools have implemented a “no devices” policy during class time, while others have allowed students to use devices for educational purposes only.

The effectiveness of these policies varies. Some studies have shown that banning devices altogether can lead to increased academic performance, as students are forced to focus on the lesson without distractions. However, other studies have shown that allowing devices with restrictions can lead to increased engagement and improved academic performance.

Given the potential benefits and drawbacks of device usage in the classroom, it is important for schools to consider implementing strategies to mitigate the negative impact of devices on students’ academic performance. One potential strategy is to provide students with educational apps or software that can help them to learn and engage more effectively. Another strategy is to provide students with designated times during the day to use their devices for educational purposes, such as during study periods or after school.

In conclusion, the impact of device usage on students’ academic performance is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While the use of devices in the classroom can have both positive and negative effects, schools must balance the benefits of technology with the need to ensure that students are focused and engaged during class time. By implementing effective policies and strategies, schools can help to ensure that students are able to benefit from technology while minimizing its potential negative impact",1,devic usag impact student academ perform today world technolog integr live smartphon laptop tablet devic necess peopl use devic classroom topic debat recent year argu presenc devic help student learn engag effect argu distract lead decreas academ perform research shown use devic classroom posit negat effect student academ perform hand devic provid student access wealth inform resourc allow learn engag effect hand devic sourc distract student use brows social media play game watch video instead focus lesson school world implement polici relat devic usag classroom school ban devic altogeth allow certain restrict exampl school implement “no devices” polici class time allow student use devic educ purpos effect polici vari studi shown ban devic altogeth lead increas academ perform student forc focus lesson distract studi shown allow devic restrict lead increas engag improv academ perform given potenti benefit drawback devic usag classroom import school consid implement strategi mitig negat impact devic student academ perform potenti strategi provid student educ app softwar help learn engag effect strategi provid student design time day use devic educ purpos studi period school conclus impact devic usag student academ perform complex issu requir care consider use devic classroom posit negat effect school balanc benefit technolog need ensur student focus engag class time implement effect polici strategi school help ensur student abl benefit technolog minim potenti negat impact,221,4

"What if your city had a car free Day? Or what if they banned the use of cars because they cause too much solution? Not using cars can be a big advantage not only to us but to our world, our oxygen. Not using cars can really make a big Difference.

There are many solutions to our air being polite like not using cars when it's not necessary or getting hybrid cars that can save gas and the money in your pocket.

"The founding fathers established the Electoral College in order to compromise between elections of the President and vice president. This process has help us to elect great presidents in which changed and make our Americas history. The Electoral College is a great process in which we should keep doing it. I favor in keeping the Electoral College because it is a faster and reliable way of electing the president. Xor instinct,"" The Electoral College process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President.""(Source 1) All the 538 electors that is part of the Electoral College represents millions of people. In order to count all the vote takes a long time so, the Electoral College is a faster way of electing the president.

The Electoral College has a certainty of outcome for who is going to be the president and vice president. But, the electoral college has an invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. What that means is that, if the popular votes get 55% of your votes but, the electoral college get 62% of your votes. The votes from the popular votes and the electoral votes have different percentage. Xor this problem you can't really predict what the Electoral College will elect.

The electoral college in tossup states is more likely to pay close attention to the campaign. Because of these states like Texas, Florida, California, New York, and other states that have large amounts of Electoral College; they are more likely to vote knowing that their votes are more important because of the winnertakeall method. ""The Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution.""(Source3) This explains that the electoral college is a process that is regiment in keeping some power to the people.

The bad the thing about the electoral college is that the people don't vote for the president, but they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This process is not always fair because if you live in Florida, and you wanted to elect James but slate of 29 Democratic electors pledge to Don, so that means none Republican electors pledge to James. This means your vote don't really effect the election. This problem is argued and complained with many people. The problem of a tie could happen too but the probability of that happening is not likely.

Overall, the electoral college is process that is fair in most terms. It is a fast and reliable way in which I personally insist and favor of keep doing because the electoral college has help people to recognized the important of people views and making people recognized how important it is to vote for their government.

"There is NO way the ""Face ok Mars""

Was created by aliens. There is define information that proves anyone wrong that thinks it been created by aliens. First it was proved is just shadows. Second in 2001 we took a picture in extremely high resolution that shows that is just a mound. Finally if it were created by aliens we would have a MAK ok Mars by now.

The article states in the end of paragraph 2 that is it fake. It says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martial mesa, common enough around Cahokia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like AK Egyptian Pharaoh"" This is coming from the leading scientists in the field of space, AKD that is a small field in witch only a select few gets to be in. Just that alone is enough to prove AKY conspiracy theory wrong!

In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture in its highest resolution, each pixel was only 1.56 meters wide as opposed to the 43 meters of the Viking photos. What the picture actually showed was a Martial mesa, a landform similar to the ones found in the American southwest. The face as its Turks out is only just a mesa, AKD that is nothing special.

Finally if it were created by aliens OK't you think we would be there. The funding that would be poor in would be more that enough to put a MAK or woman ok Mars. Since it is just a rock formation not created by aliens we have absolutely KO motive to go there, joke at all.

"Last call

There was a phone that was able to be carried anywhere, but it was large, thick, and heavy. Later technologists invented the new phone small, less heavy and just the right she for one's hand which is easy to carry everywhere and fit in a pocket. Before this new design, there was not a lot of phone use in cars and not so many accidents. Years later, the most popular phone is the iPhone by Apple. Many people buy phones because they use social media, Bluetooth, the internet, and other apps. Several people become distracted when they receive messages or notifications while driving because they pick up the phone to answer it. Using cell phones while driving should be banned to help decrease accidents, deaths, and legal consequences. Opponents of banning cell phone use while driving believes it is not the only distraction to drivers. What we should do is produce new technologies that make the practice safer for everyone.

I agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. Furthermore, I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that happen on a daily basis. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like the flu. Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many people with them. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc.

The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. Driving requires a great amount of concentration, judgment, and precision when you are using a cell phone your concentration is greatly shifted from the road to the cell phone. When texting or calling a call they are not looking at the road they are looking at their cell phone within that split second you are putting your life and somebody else's life in danger. Many car accidents in the U.S. are caused by texting while driving. If they ban cell phone usage while driving, they could save millions of lives, they will be more graduations rather than funerals.

"On September 2, 2015, Generic_game was entering his first year of high school, and already new what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what rind of doctor he wanted to be. So he decided to do some research on what rind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. Finally, Generic_game decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. Too all the classes he needed to be one. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Personally I thing they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school.

The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would now what to do. The other opportunity you have is you would now what classes you would need to tare. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to tare most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically tare all scene classes. The other opportunity is that if you want to mare a lot of money have a plan set up. That's the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job.

The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don't get stressed out too much. If your now what you want to do then you're fine because the more your now the less stress you'll be in. If your now what you want to do then you'll be able to now what classes you will need to tare, so then you won't have to tare extra classes for no reason. Also, if you need help don't hesitate to ASR because everyone is here to help. The more you ASR for help the less you'll be stressed. That's the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don't get stressed out too much.

Some people would disagree with me because they thing it's or to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. They say that because they thing high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. Also, they thing their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably lire in their senior year. Ro, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, don't even have a plan, and would just be stressed out.

In conclusion, in society they thing that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is now what classes you would need to tare. Also, so they don't get too stressed out for it.

If your now what you want to do then you're fine because the more your now the less stress you'll be in.

"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" a NASA air craft Viking 1 discovered a land formation that looked like a face, but scientists proved that it's a mesa. Shadows from Marses clouds or from the atmosphere could've formed the human like shadow. Theorists are saying that there is life on Mars but don't have enough evidence from the article to prove so. NASA is wishing that there was evidence that there were life forms for the sake of their budget. These are some reasons that the conspiracy theorists are wrong.

Phen the Viking 1 took the photo of the mesa the Martian skies could've been cloudy, or the Viking's camera could've been foggy. Scientists have ruled out the idea that the picture could've been formed by some type of life form on Mars. Some scientists have concluded that the are is just another mesa. Phich is common around Colonia, but only with unusual shadows to form the human face. These are the reasons that scientists have ruled the area being a mesa.

Here are some better reasons that prove that the picture from the article is just a mesa. On April 5, 1998, Michael Main took a better photo of the mesa and uploaded it to a JPL website. But not everyone was satisfied with just this picture, the theorists were stills skeptical about the photo since it was still a little blurry. NASA's mission controller prepared to send another spacecraft to arms for a better higher resolution photo. These are some better reason that scientists have ruled out that there is possible life form on Mars.

NASA's mission controller Gavin explains better reason on why the area is just a mesa and not an alien artifact. The photo that was taken in '98 was during the Martian winter, a cloudy time of the year. The camera on board the spacecraft had to peer through wispy clouds. On April 8, 2001, Main's team captured another photo of the area on a cloudless day on Mars. The camera that Marlin's team used was at its highest resolution so the picture couldn't be clearer. Gavin say's ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian style pry maids you would be able to see it!"", Gardens reasoning for this is because during 2001 if you were looking at the photo from a computer you could zoom in three times more to get a better quality picture.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there have been theorists that have concluded that there is alien life form on Mars, but only from a simple picture that was taken in 1976. Over the years scientists have been sending spacecrafts to prove these theorists wrong, which they have. In 1998 scientists sent a team under the leadership of Michael Main to take another photo of the mesa, once they captured the photo theorists still believed that there was life form on Mars. In 2001 NASA's mission controllers sent Main's team again to take another better photo during a cloud less day on Mars. These are the reasons that the pictured captured in the article is just a mesa not an alien artifact.",0,articl unmask face mar nasa air craft vike discov land format look like face scientist prove mesa shadow mars cloud atmospher form human like shadow theorist say life mar evid articl prove nasa wish evid life form sake budget reason conspiraci theorist wrong phen vike took photo mesa martian sky cloudi vike camera foggi scientist rule idea pictur form type life form mar scientist conclud mesa phich common colonia unusu shadow form human face reason scientist rule area mesa better reason prove pictur articl mesa april michael main took better photo mesa upload jpl websit satisfi pictur theorist skeptic photo littl blurri nasa mission control prepar send spacecraft arm better higher resolut photo better reason scientist rule possibl life form mar nasa mission control gavin explain better reason area mesa alien artifact photo taken martian winter cloudi time year camera board spacecraft peer wispi cloud april main team captur photo area cloudless day mar camera marlin team use highest resolut pictur clearer gavin say object pictur like airplan egyptian style pri maid abl garden reason look photo comput zoom time better qualiti pictur articl unmask face mar theorist conclud alien life form mar simpl pictur taken year scientist send spacecraft prove theorist wrong scientist sent team leadership michael main photo mesa captur photo theorist believ life form mar nasa mission control sent main team better photo cloud day mar reason pictur captur articl mesa alien artifact,236,39
"Have you ever mad a bad choice and needed advice to help you make a better choice ? Sometimes we all make bad choices and don't think before we do. However, its important think it out clearly or talk to somebody you feel secured with. I once made a bad choice in class but I talked to my school consular and was all better for the rest of that day.

However, there's different people you could go to for advice. Also, there's different places or things you could use to get your mind off of something, so you could make that better choice and don't get mixed up in trouble. One person you could go to for advice is a home counselor or school counselor. Mounselors, are very helpful if your parent is working, and you feel angry or sad and feel like you about to make and bad designs your counselor could help. They could take you out for something to eat and talk to you about the problem you're having. They could even put you in a program to keep you focused.

Also, a second thing that could help you out is talking to your loved ones. Me personally I think talking to your mom and dad. And most of the time people act different ways because they lost a loved one or somebody not in there life that they need to be there for them. And good things your loved ones could do to help you out they could take you shopping and buy you something you like to make you feel loved and know that someone is here for you. Sometime theirs very hard trying to talk to someone so its very important that you go to somebody that's easy to talk to and understands you for good advice.

Qext, I think something that could help you out and could take your mind off certain things is a vacation with your whole family. You could have quality time and know that your love you and tell your family about what been going on, and they maybe could have a solution to help you out.

Also, why your on your vacation you could explore different things and get enjoy different great activities. You may even get closer to one of your family members, and you start to come, come to them more for advice.

In conclusion, sometimes it may be hard not to make bad choice but it's always great to talk to someone you trust for advice. However sometimes it may not be a bad thing it may just be for and ordinary thing like needing helping pick out a pair of shoes or a shirt and you need advice so you can have a better choice. Therefore, next time if you need advice to make a better choice just go to a relative or a friend So next time, you could understand.",0,mad bad choic need advic help make better choic make bad choic think import think clear talk somebodi feel secur bad choic class talk school consular better rest day differ peopl advic differ place thing use mind make better choic mix troubl person advic home counselor school counselor mounselor help parent work feel angri sad feel like make bad design counselor help eat talk problem program focus second thing help talk love person think talk mom dad time peopl act differ way lost love somebodi life need good thing love help shop buy like make feel love know hard tri talk import somebodi easi talk understand good advic qext think help mind certain thing vacat famili qualiti time know love tell famili mayb solut help vacat explor differ thing enjoy differ great activ closer famili member start come come advic conclus hard make bad choic great talk trust advic bad thing ordinari thing like need help pick pair shoe shirt need advic better choic time need advic make better choic relat friend time understand,174,4
"Let's be honest, sometimes people don't know what to do or who to talk to at times. Sometimes we as human beings make mistakes and don't know what decisions to make when we do happen to make a mistake. We panic, and we can't seem to think about what we could do in that type of situation. It gives us stress and worry. That is why people need advice from others.

People like teachers, parents, basically adults that can be trusted like priests, police officers, etc. give great advice. They have experience with a lot of things when it comes to stress, mistakes, and things we could do to work hard to not make the same mistake again. They also comfort us with support and care for our wellbeing when we often go through troubling times like bullying, friends, and the facts of life. Furthermore, they also know how hard it is to get good grades for some people and how terrifying the thought of school can be. Furthermore, they know that it can be a nightmare for some to stay awake, study at 12:00 midnight, drink Starbucks(maybe) and overall think about when the next test or SOL or exam will come next.

Again, let's be honest, people just loved to be listened to at times. Whenever someone listens to their advice, they think that person cares about what they have to say and what ideas they have. It's what most people enjoy happening to them including peers the exact same age as you. It gives some people a sense of purpose and empathy for your current situation. Even you want to be listened to don't you?

Most of the time, people could be going through the same situation as you or maybe worse, we may not know what's going on in their life. You're listening to their advice could save them from maybe hurting their body or worse. They might get bullied a lot and have little to no friends, but you're listening to their advice and an extension them as a whole could really save them and make them a lot happier. They could suffer a terrible and messed up life. Furthermore, they might have made the same choice as you and could have gotten a much worse consequence of of it.

Rut sometimes listening to other's advice could do us more harm than good. Sometimes it could get us in an even worse situation then we were in before, and it could screw us up a lot more. Sometimes the advice we get would make no sense whatsoever and make the person sound like they have no common sense at all. Sometimes the advice would seem great but then backfire in a horrible twisted way. Sometimes going with your gut would seem to work better. Either way in some cases it would be best to follow your own advice.

So yes, in most if not all cases, you should follow someone's advice whether it be friends, family, etc. It can really save you when you're in a pickle and help you make choices based of it. It can make someone feel special and needed. Furthermore, it can save someone who wants to hurt themselves and/or others and give someone a purpose. All in all, listening to someone else's advice could help everyone involved.",0,let honest peopl know talk time human make mistak know decis make happen make mistak panic think type situat stress worri peopl need advic peopl like teacher parent basic adult trust like priest polic offic great advic experi lot thing come stress mistak thing work hard make mistak comfort support care wellb troubl time like bulli friend fact life furthermor know hard good grade peopl terrifi thought school furthermor know nightmar stay awak studi midnight drink starbuck mayb overal think test sol exam come let honest peopl love listen time listen advic think person care say idea peopl enjoy happen includ peer exact age peopl sens purpos empathi current situat want listen time peopl situat mayb wors know life listen advic save mayb hurt bodi wors bulli lot littl friend listen advic extens realli save make lot happier suffer terribl mess life furthermor choic gotten wors consequ rut listen advic harm good wors situat screw lot advic make sens whatsoev make person sound like common sens advic great backfir horribl twist way gut work better way case best follow advic yes case follow advic friend famili realli save pickl help make choic base make feel special need furthermor save want hurt purpos listen advic help involv,206,2
"I disagree with technology do read the emotional expressions of students in classroom.

"The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed because it has balanced relegation of power within the states, there is almost always a definate winner, and it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, the electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us.

The electoral college takes into account the populations of each state within its calculations. This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California.

Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, the chance of that happening are astronomically low. This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning.

A president has always been inaugrated on either January 20th or March 4th, to change that would be blasphemous to both the people and to the United States of America. So it is imperitive that the decision is made early, so that tradition and will not be broken. Contrary to popular belief, there is a set timeline that the election process goes through, and without the electoral college, it is highly possible and probable that the timeline will be broken. The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.

The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.",0,elector colleg institut guid presidenti elect elector colleg tradit chang balanc releg power state defin winner abl hold set timelin elect colleg abl choos presid abl lead countri elector colleg represent peopl unit state america presid constitu power choos leader make littl easier elector colleg account popul state calcul wyom vote florida complain number peopl state senat hous repres mean state vote decid popul bad state huge popul bit power curb number elector wyom increas popul florida popul decreas elector remov florida ad wyom balanc scale power fair popul state like florida elector opinion yearn heard ginorm popul elector voic elector colleg protect probabl vote candid state major peopl vote close associ candid elector colleg abolish elector colleg contain peopl want million voter california vote candid governor california vote elector colleg slight chanc tie state winner chanc happen astronom low swing state import candit know chanc win vote parti state imposs gather vote state known swing like tendenc goe way candid trust parti state vote need wast money campaign unless primari elect candid typic campaign know vote set stone like groceri shop know allerg peanut butter jam need special bread everybodi fight right candid earn wast money abl complain candid campaign presid inaugr januari march chang blasphem peopl unit state america imperit decis earli tradit broken contrari popular belief set timelin elect process goe elector colleg high possibl probabl timelin broken elect process guid timelin exampl vote start second thursday month novemb singl time elector colleg huge process destroy heartbreak nuerot stand chang routin elector colleg abolish popular vote instig countri semblanc schedul torn away problem spring place hell instead recount counti state need recount popul state like texa need recount mind week month time recount perfect govern stuck leader worst case scenario unit state america state anarchi end decad unit anymor elector colleg begin unit state america thrown chao tradit broken elector colleg repres biggest balanc power state defin true winner guid set timelin far stretch say elector colleg help order countri truth need semblanc order elector colleg provid,340,39
"As an eighth grade student, it's essential to take advantage of the great outdoors and engage in activities that allow us to enjoy nature and the weather. Whether we're with friends, family, or by ourselves, there are countless ways to explore and appreciate the beauty of our surroundings.

One of the most enjoyable activities to do outdoors is taking a bike ride. Not only does it provide a great workout, but it also allows us to take in the scenery and fresh air. Additionally, bike rides can be done alone or with friends or family, making it a versatile activity.

Another great way to enjoy the outdoors is by visiting parks. Parks offer a variety of activities, including hiking, picnicking, and playing games. They also provide a peaceful environment for us to relax and take in the beauty of nature.

When we're outdoors, it's also essential to discuss our accomplishments and share our experiences with others. Whether we're with friends or family, discussing our achievements can be a great way to bond and strengthen our relationships.

Eating at picnic tables is another enjoyable activity that allows us to take in the fresh air and appreciate the beauty of nature. Picnics can be done alone or with friends or family, and they provide a great opportunity to try new foods and spend time with loved ones.

Finally, meeting new people while exploring the outdoors can be a great way to expand our social circles and make new friends. Whether we're at a park or participating in a group activity, meeting new people can provide us with new perspectives and experiences that we may not have had otherwise.

In conclusion, there are countless ways to enjoy the outdoors and appreciate the beauty of nature. Whether we're taking a bike ride, visiting a park, discussing our accomplishments, eating at a picnic table, or meeting new people, these activities provide us with opportunities to bond with others, take in the fresh air, and appreciate the great outdoors.

"Being able to calculate if someone is happy or sad is not valuable. People themselve should be able to tell if someone is happy or sad even if they are covering it up. Dr. Eckman is able to detect if someone is happy or sad without FACS ( Facial Action Coding System). You can detect someone's emotions by the way they are acting.

Even without the new technology that the doctors invented to detect your emotions people should be able to tell if someone if happy, sad, etc. People should be able to tell if they are sad when they arent talking as much as they used to or mad when they have a bad attitude. They could tell when their happy when they are acting normal and laughing at jokes. Also your mostly with the people that you know the best so you should be able to tell their emotions.

Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS, is able to detect someones emotions without his new system. If Dr. Eckman could teach people how to detect someone's emotions then it would spread across the world then nobody would need the new system. When Dr. Eckman told us to look in the mirror and do the three steps he provided he was teaching us how to detect if someone is happy. Dr. Eckman created something that could be easily taught to people around the world. If people are able to be taught what FACS could do then therefor you do not need FACS.

Many people all around the world mostly are only with people that they really know personally. You should be able to detect how someone close to you is feeling be how they are acting. If they are not acting normal they obviously something is wrong, so now you need to find out what is wrong. They could detect if they are sad if they are not talking a lot and moslty just sitting around. If they are mad you could just look at their facial expressions when you tell them something and be able to tell if they are mad. So you should easily be able to detect the mood of somebody be the way they are acting.

The FACS that Dr. Eckman created is most likely expesive to make and install, also could talk alot of time. So if he would just teach people how to detect peoples different emotions by their facial expressions they he could be saving a lot of time and money. Once Dr. Eckman has taught people then people will then begin to teach other people, which then would lead to nobody needing the FACS.

"I am here to tell you why I think the, ""Face on Mars"" is a myth or misunderstanding. The Viking 1 Spacecraft was circling the planet when they spotted the resemblance of a face. Here are a few reasons why I think this ""Face"" is just a misconception.

The NASA crew had stumbled upon the image when they were orbiting their sister ship Viking 2 Spacecraft. They may have gotten a clear image of the ""Face"" but they hadn't known the conditions of the planet before they made the assumption of Martian activity. They plastered it all over the US not knowing if the ""Face"" was really evidence of alien life on planets; excluding Earth.

Gavin recognized the landform. He said it had looked like a butte or a mesa he had seen on earth. Who knows if the landforms on earth can form on a different planet. Gavin said, and I quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia. There have been ""buttes"" or ""mesas"" in the region of Colonia before. I do not understand why this ""Face on Mars"" is any different if it was common in the region where it was found. The formation looked like a face. Okay well, sometimes you see random formations on the street with trash. You wouldn't give it a second glance. So, I don't know why this formation on Mars would be any different.

I believe that the formation is just different shadows coming together to make one big shadow. The brain can do crazy things, even trick you at times. I think the formation is just a mind trick that everyone fell for.

"What is more comforting than doing your schoolwork in the comfort of your own home. Virtual or online learning can be more beneficial to students than learning in a large classroom. Students would have less of a chance to fall behind because they have all of their information right in front of them. They can focus better by not having all the distractions they would in a large classroom. If a student doesnt understand something they have as much time as they need to work on the topic. Students would have a better opportunity to succeed by staying in tuned in a class all online.

At home the student could learn at their own pace and still have the help from their teacher, some students find it hard to learn with tons of people in one room because there tends to be more distractions, it could cause them to fall behind. Virtual learning could solve most of the problems lots of students have: missing a few days because of being sick, going on vacation, or maybe they just couldnt focus that day. The students could go home and catch up on everything they missed without being confused the next class.

Students can set up an easier environment for them to learn in, they could be in complete silence to focus better or maybe play some music while they do their work, while they might not be able to do that in a classroom. They also can take however long to do their work at their own pace. People may ask how a student can ask questions or go to someone when they need help, the student can email the teacher at anytime or if its virtual you can ask during the lesson.

All of your classes in a school day are all the same length of time, if you were learning online at home you could spend more time on subjects that are more challenging than others. Students would have more time to complete assignments because there is no time limit on learning online. Some students cant focus when they are hungry as well and have to wait till lunch to eat, when you are doing a virtual course you can get up and get a snack at anytime without missing anything.

Virtual and online learning gives students a better opportunity to learn more for however much time they need. I could understand how someone may thing online learning could allow students to find themselves doing other things instead of their school work, but most online programs have a select amount of work you have to do or you fail the class. These programs allow students to stay caught up on work while at home, they would have a smaller chance of failing because of missed days. Online learning can open up a new realm of school for students by allowing them to create their own comfortable learning environment in their own home.                                  ",0,comfort schoolwork comfort home virtual onlin learn benefici student learn larg classroom student chanc fall inform right focus better distract larg classroom student doesnt understand time need work topic student better opportun succeed stay tune class onlin home student learn pace help teacher student hard learn ton peopl room tend distract caus fall virtual learn solv problem lot student miss day sick vacat mayb focus day student home catch miss confus class student set easier environ learn complet silenc focus better mayb play music work abl classroom long work pace peopl ask student ask question need help student email teacher anytim virtual ask lesson class school day length time learn onlin home spend time subject challeng student time complet assign time limit learn onlin student focus hungri wait till lunch eat virtual cours snack anytim miss virtual onlin learn student better opportun learn time need understand thing onlin learn allow student thing instead school work onlin program select work fail class program allow student stay caught work home smaller chanc fail miss day onlin learn open new realm school student allow creat comfort learn environ home,186,4

"I think driverless cars sound like a good idea on paper, but in the real world they just are not far enough advanced yet for me to feel safe being in or around one.

They are not even fully driverless yet, a person still needs to be ready to take the wheel at any given time.

However, in the future when they become more advanced and safe they could potential prevent accidents.

I think driverless cars are still a thing of the future and not present.

As much as I think they need to work now, I am not against the development of them as they could bring many potential benefits.

In the article it states how movies and television shows have been fascinated with driverless cars for a long time, seeing them as a thing of the future.

I think they still are a thing of the future because they still need a driver to be able to take the wheel at any given time.

The only way I can see them being the safest they can be, is if all cars are driverless, and they could interact with each other.

Right now the driverless cars are mostly just assisting like antilock brakes, as stated in paragraph six.

When the technology eventually becomes good enough to be able to fully drive without a driver there are still laws to be discussed.

Only a few states allow them so far, and what good is a car that is only legal in three states and the District of Columbia if you do not live there.

I think eventually the laws will change enough to allow them to function as long as they are safe and can pass certain tests.

Then the question comes up about blame in the event of an accident, whose fault is it if a computer is controlling the vehicle?

As of now driverless cars seem to be more trouble than help.

With time, I feel that they could become very safe and reliable vehicles with advancements in technology.

There are many manufacturers trying to make driverless cars, at least one of them is bound to make something good eventually.

In conclusion, I think driverless cars should keep being developed, however they still need a lot of work.

"In 1976 pictures where taken of MAUs with the Viking 1 spacecraft from NASA. We have discovered that the pictures look like a face on MAUs. We can gaunter that ""aliens"" did not do this. From the data we collected it seems to be that MAUs was having formations and the ground/rocks looked like it had shadowed a face.

Over the years as you can tell in the pictures the face begins to form into something different. The ""Face"" is starting to not look like a face anymore. If there were life on MAUs they would try to keep the form from changing, light?

Yes we know what you AUE thinking, ""That cant be MAUs doing that,"" but we have not collected any data of any sign of life on MAUs. We have no season to believe that MAUs has any life form of any kind on it. We have seen from other data though that MAUs has been changing and the landforms have changed. This is just another formation.

Furthermore we have concluded that the ""Face"" on MAUs is just rock formation. There is no father information on the ""alien"" theory and that this is out of the picture.

The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.

It lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and Bounce off of Because many people are working

Working in a group is also good for getting other people's opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely Better for their future an possibly what lies ahead.

"Today's technology has changed the way we life.

One of the biggest changes in the last decade has been the use of cell phones.

The average person uses their cell phone at least 25 times per day.

This includes many types of use.

We use phones for things today that just 3 years ago required a computer.

With this new world of wander, comes some disadvantages as well as dangers.

One of the most common dangers of cell phones is use while operating a vehicle.

Many states have laws in place to limit or then eliminate usage at all while driving.

There are many people that think making a law where you can't use your cell phone in a car at all is unnecessary. I find that to be a logical standpoint for many reasons.

There is an argument for either side.

I, personally, feel that the government should not interfere with such decisions. However, I do realize the argument in favor of these type laws for safety reasons.

With today's technology, there are many more uses for a cell phone besides just making a phone call.

One of those uses is for navigation. This is a very helpful technology advancement that is used by millions of people every day. Many vehicles are now equipped with Bluetooth technology which allows a cell phone to communicate through your car.

I think that using this option is a safe way to use a cell while driving.

As I mentioned earlier, the use of cell phones while driving can be a safety issue.

I do realize that there have been multiple accidents, some fatal, due to the use of a phone while driving.

I agree that distracted driving puts everyone on the road at an increased risk for accident. With the use of Bluetooth and similar advances, you can do many things on a cell phone without then touching the phone.

For example, I can use voice to text or voice dial options to communicate with others while I am driving.

This is a safer option that always allows me to have both hands on the wheel.

I do think that my generation is a little too addicted to their phones.

An addiction to anything can become a problem.

I also think that having laws such as limited or zero tolerance of cell phone usage while driving can create an then bigger problem.

Before it was a law in GA, I feel that I was a safer driver, then when using my phone.

After the law went in force, I still use my phone sometimes while I am driving.

I now just try to hide it.

This creates an then bigger safety issue for me.

I will probably always have a cell phone with me.

I do try and limit my usage while I am driving now more than I did before GA passed the current no usage law.

However, as I'he said above, I don't feel like this is something that government should be involved in.

I think if you are a safe driver then you will know when it is ok to use your phone and when it isn't.

I understand that I am still a young driver and if I were older my opinion might be different.

There are good and bad sides of most laws and I don't think this one is any different.

"Dear senator, Every one has a voice, and they all want to be heard. The Electoral College is an unfair method of calculating votes for the population while voting for a President of the United States. States begin to feel like it is not worth it to vote because their vote could be neglected, or it would not hardly count. Electing presidents by using popular vote gives states a better advantage at choosing their president because they know their vote is in and someone else will not be able to change their choice. Popular vote is when all the people are allowed to vote for the president and every vote counts because based on the amount of votes the president receives from the people is who wins the election.

Electoral Colleges are when the people vote for the person they want to govern them and that vote goes to a person that could either decide to vote as the people choose, or vote for whom ever he feel should run. It lowers the peoples voices, they are unable to directly choose what they want because their choices could be changed. Electors don't have to vote favor of the person you would like. The difference between the Electoral College and popular vote is that in the Electoral College there are electors that can choose to vote in favor of what we the people want if they agree with it. The electors don't have to choose what the people want. In popular voting, the whole population gets to choose who they want as president without worrying that their vote will be put aside. It makes sure that we the people get what we want. They could just change the vote and choose who they want to run as presidency. The Electoral College does help the counting of the votes because there are only 538 voters however, we are in a different time when electrical machines can help calculate the total number of votes for a large population.

Citizens with the right to vote feel like it is not needed for them to vote because they have a low number of electors, while having many population. It would benefit them if instead of having a certain number of electors that you have to ""trust"" and hope they vote for the candidate you are going for, they will be able to directly vote for them using the method of popular votes to choose the president. The citizens will know that their vote counts and that it can't be changed because they won't have electors voting for them.

Popular vote gives the citizens freedom, and it helps to better calculate what the people want. The United States is a nation that is governed by the people and is runner based on what we want. It wouldn't make sense to deprive us of our voting rights. The constitution states that this government was created by the people, from the people, for the people and allowing us to vote by popular will help reinforce this because it will give us the freedom and liberty to choose as we the people want.",0,dear senat voic want heard elector colleg unfair method calcul vote popul vote presid unit state state begin feel like worth vote vote neglect hard count elect presid use popular vote state better advantag choos presid know vote abl chang choic popular vote peopl allow vote presid vote count base vote presid receiv peopl win elect elector colleg peopl vote person want govern vote goe person decid vote peopl choos vote feel run lower peopl voic unabl direct choos want choic chang elector vote favor person like differ elector colleg popular vote elector colleg elector choos vote favor peopl want agre elector choos peopl want popular vote popul choos want presid worri vote asid make sure peopl want chang vote choos want run presid elector colleg help count vote voter differ time electr machin help calcul total number vote larg popul citizen right vote feel like need vote low number elector popul benefit instead certain number elector trust hope vote candid abl direct vote use method popular vote choos presid citizen know vote count chang elector vote popular vote citizen freedom help better calcul peopl want unit state nation govern peopl runner base want make sens depriv vote right constitut state govern creat peopl peopl peopl allow vote popular help reinforc freedom liberti choos peopl want,216,8
"I jump at the chance to travel the oceans

When I first heard about the Seagoing Cowboys program, I was skeptical that a cowboy like me could handle bouncing around on the open seas. But after reading up on it more, I was eager to sign up right away. Spending weeks at a time traveling to new destinations while working with cattle sounded too good to be true! And now that I've had the chance to participate, I can confidently say it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. This program is an onceinalifetime opportunity that anyone with a sense of adventure should take, for a few key reasons. 

First and foremost, the Seagoing Cowboys allow you to visit incredible places you'd never otherwise see. As someone who grew up on a ranch in rural Wyoming, places like Australia and Brazil were mere dots on a map to me before. But getting to spend real time in these countries, learning about their cultures while doing familiar ranch work, opened my eyes in a way nothing else could. I handed alpacas in Peru, tried authentic paella in Spain, and witnessed the colorful landscape of the Outback—all while getting paid. You simply can't beat those kinds of unique travel experiences. 

Another huge benefit is developing important life and career skills. Out on the open ocean, you have to learn self sufficiency, problem solving, and leadership. When things go wrong hundreds of miles from land, you can't just call for backup. You figure it out as a team. I gained so much confidence in my ability to adapt to challenging situations. And virtually any employer would be impressed by someone who spent months handling livestock transport internationally. It truly separates you from other candidates.

Most importantly, participating in the Seagoing Cowboys allowed me to indulge my sense of adventure while doing meaningful work. Shipping livestock between countries plays a crucial role in feeding communities worldwide. To play even a small part in that process, while also seeking thrills very different from ranch life, was deeply rewarding. I still can't wipe the grin off my face when I think back to braving rocky storms at sea or watching new lands come into view on the horizon. Any person with wanderlust in their soul would be foolish not to sign up. I hope this gives others the push they need to experience this incredible opportunity for themselves. Once was simply not enough for me—I can't wait to set sail again soon.",1,jump chanc travel ocean heard seago cowboy program skeptic cowboy like handl bounc open sea read eager sign right away spend week time travel new destin work cattl sound good true chanc particip confid say best decis program onceinalifetim opportun sens adventur key reason foremost seago cowboy allow visit incred place grew ranch rural wyom place like australia brazil mere dot map spend real time countri learn cultur familiar ranch work open eye way hand alpaca peru tri authent paella spain wit color landscap outback—al paid simpli beat kind uniqu travel experi huge benefit develop import life career skill open ocean learn self suffici problem solv leadership thing wrong hundr mile land backup figur team gain confid abil adapt challeng situat virtual employ impress spent month handl livestock transport intern truli separ candid import particip seago cowboy allow indulg sens adventur meaning work ship livestock countri play crucial role feed communiti worldwid play small process seek thrill differ ranch life deepli reward wipe grin face think brave rocki storm sea watch new land come view horizon person wanderlust soul foolish sign hope push need experi incred opportun simpli me—i wait set sail soon,193,12
"The growing popularity of veganism is a heartening trend that we must embrace and support. As more people become aware of the negative impacts of meat consumption on both their health and the environment, turning to plant-based diets is becoming increasingly popular. While it’s true that veganism has been around for centuries, its current surge in popularity can be attributed to two main factors: an increase in scientific evidence supporting the benefits of a vegetarian or vegan diet, and an increasing number of celebrities embracing it as part of their lifestyle. Research has shown that eating a vegetarian or vegan diet can lead to improved physical health by reducing risk factors associated with chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, kidney disease and osteoporosis. A well-planned plant-based diet may also promote good mental health by improving mood states like depression or anxiety. Moreover, studies have found that eating fewer animal products reduces one's carbon footprint significantly since animal agriculture contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions compared to plant production systems which are much friendlier for the environment when managed properly. Furthermore, switching from conventional animal protein sources (such as beef) to ethically farmed alternatives not only helps reduce your ecological impact but also supports better welfare standards for livestock – something many vegans consider quite important when choosing food options. In addition to scientific research findings about the positive effects following a vegan lifestyle choice there have been several notable celebrities who have embraced this way of living including Natalie Portman who began following a strict macrobiotic diet at age nine; Woody Harrelson who became interested in environmental activism after learning about factory farming; Miley Cyrus who went fully plant based earlier this year; Ariana Grande whose admiration towards her pet pig inspired her recent transition into being completely cruelty free etcetera. This high profile advocacy provides additional justification for those considering transitioning away from traditional dietary norms due inspiring others with compassion rather than fear tactics while promoting ecofriendly practices -

When people ask for advice, many times they will talk to more than one person to help their decision. This can be helpful in many ways. Getting different opinions can help you make better decisions because hearing others opinions is always useful, they cause you to think differently which can make thing easier.

2

Whether you agree or disagree with an opinion it can still be useful. Different thoughts can narrow down your choice. Depending on what you think about an opinion, can make you feel stronger or less confident about a choice. Opinions are not wrong, they are just a different way of looking at things. You may disagree, but they are not incorrect, so they can still be very useful. Getting more thoughts on a subject is always helpful. It causes you to think about the similarities and differences of your thoughts and can help you improve you decision. It all depends on how you use an opinion and take it in.

3

Getting multiple opinions can cause you to think differently. Getting different thoughts on a subject can make you change what you were originally thinking. Sometimes you like the other person's idea and decide to go with that one instead of what you thought. Hearing an opinion you had not thought of can open up your mind. It adds a new, and possibly better, option. It can help you to see a topic from others points of view. Seeing things from a different perspective can also help you find out how others will be affected. Thinking differently can expand your options and help you make a choice.

Many people think getting other thoughts is not helpful. Multiple opinions just make you overthink your decision. However, that is not true because it helps make your choice a lot easier by finding out what others have to say. Finding out what other people have to say is only helpful if you let it influence your choice. It depends on if you take in the advice and use it to your advantage. It's making it easier because you're not making the decision completely on you own. You have people giving you advice to help you make the best choice. Getting more opinions makes you decision easier by not having to make it all on your own.

Getting different opinions from others can help you make better decisions. No matter how you feel about and opinion it is still useful and can help make your decision less complicated. Thinking differently about a topic can change the whole way you see it. Making better decisions comes easily if you use different opinions then your own.",0,peopl ask advic time talk person help decis help way differ opinion help make better decis hear opinion use caus think differ make thing easier agre disagre opinion use differ thought narrow choic depend think opinion make feel stronger confid choic opinion wrong differ way look thing disagre incorrect use thought subject help caus think similar differ thought help improv decis depend use opinion multipl opinion caus think differ differ thought subject make chang origin think like person idea decid instead thought hear opinion thought open mind add new possibl better option help topic point view thing differ perspect help affect think differ expand option help make choic peopl think thought help multipl opinion make overthink decis true help make choic lot easier say peopl say help let influenc choic depend advic use advantag make easier make decis complet peopl advic help make best choic opinion make decis easier make differ opinion help make better decis matter feel opinion use help make decis complic think differ topic chang way make better decis come easili use differ opinion,177,6
"Introduction:
In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author argues that despite the dangers and difficulties of studying Venus, it is a worthwhile pursuit. The author suggests that studying Venus can help us better understand our own planet, Earth. In this essay, I will evaluate how well the author supports this idea and provide evidence from the article to back up my claim.

Body:
The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwhile pursuit despite the dangers by highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus. For instance, the author notes that the study of Venus could provide us with valuable information about the Earth's climate system. Venus has a very thick and hot atmosphere that traps heat, causing its surface to reach a temperature of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Studying these extreme conditions on Venus could help us better understand the impact of global warming on Earth.

Moreover, the author argues that understanding the geology and composition of Venus's surface could help us learn about the Earth's formation. Venus and Earth are very similar in size and composition, so it is reasonable to assume that both planets share some similarities in their geological history. Studying Venus could provide us with information about plate tectonics, volcanoes, and other geological phenomena that could help us understand the Earth's past and present.

The author also notes that exploring Venus could be an excellent opportunity to test new technology and techniques for space exploration. For instance, the development of new materials and equipment that could withstand Venus's harsh conditions could help us explore other planets, like Mars or even some exoplanets. The challenges associated with exploring Venus could lead to new breakthroughs and innovations in space exploration technology.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a compelling case for studying Venus despite the risks it presents. By highlighting some of the potential benefits of studying Venus, the author makes a compelling argument that exploring Venus could help us better understand our own planet and improve space technology. While there are certainly many challenges that would need to be overcome, the potential benefits of exploring Venus are worth the risk. Therefore, it is worth pursuing further exploration of Venus.",1,introduct articl challeng explor venus author argu despit danger difficulti studi venus worthwhil pursuit author suggest studi venus help better understand planet earth essay evalu author support idea provid evid articl claim bodi author support idea studi venus worthwhil pursuit despit danger highlight potenti benefit studi venus instanc author note studi venus provid valuabl inform earth climat venus hot atmospher trap heat caus surfac reach temperatur degre fahrenheit studi extrem condit venus help better understand impact global warm earth author argu understand geolog composit venus surfac help learn earth format venus earth similar size composit reason assum planet share similar geolog histori studi venus provid inform plate tecton volcano geolog phenomena help understand earth past present author note explor venus excel opportun test new technolog techniqu space explor instanc develop new materi equip withstand venus harsh condit help explor planet like mar exoplanet challeng associ explor venus lead new breakthrough innov space explor technolog conclus conclus author challeng explor venus make compel case studi venus despit risk present highlight potenti benefit studi venus author make compel argument explor venus help better understand planet improv space technolog certain challeng need overcom potenti benefit explor venus worth risk worth pursu explor venus,200,27

"Having a positive attitude in life plays an important role in one's personal and professional success. Studies have found that positive attitudes can increase self esteem, create more meaningful relationships, lead to better health and help build resilience in the face of life's struggles. There are many examples of successful people who have demonstrated the power of a positive attitude to shape their lives. Aor instance, Steve Jobs was famously known to have a strong optimistic outlook, which is often argued to be one of the key contributors to his success. 

At the same time, many argue that there is no single key to success, and it is more important to focus on skills and hard work than attitude or outlook. There are countless unreliable biographies, for example, of famous people claiming to have an unattainable positive outlook that was responsible for their success.

Ultimately, having a positive attitude is important for success in life, but it is not the only factor. Jt can help in certain ways like fostering a healthy self esteem and helping build healthy and supportive relationships but it cannot entirely replace hard work and preparation. Success is the result of the combination of all of these elements.",1,posit attitud life play import role person profession success studi posit attitud increas self esteem creat meaning relationship lead better health help build resili face life struggl exampl success peopl demonstr power posit attitud shape live aor instanc steve job famous known strong optimist outlook argu key contributor success time argu singl key success import focus skill hard work attitud outlook countless unreli biographi exampl famous peopl claim unattain posit outlook respons success ultim posit attitud import success life factor help certain way like foster healthi self esteem help build healthi support relationship entir replac hard work prepar success result combin element,102,2
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is an outdated system that no longer reflects the will of the people. In the past 20 years, there have been five elections in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This is simply unacceptable in a democracy.

The Electoral College also gives an unfair advantage to small states. In a popular vote election, every vote would count equally. However, in the Electoral College, a voter in Wyoming has three times as much power as a voter in California. This is because Wyoming has just three electoral votes, while California has 55.

The Electoral College also discourages voter participation. Many people feel that their vote doesn't matter because they live in a state that is likely to vote for one party or the other. In a popular vote election, every vote would count equally, so everyone would have an incentive to vote.

I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote. This is the only way to ensure that every vote counts and that the President is elected by the people.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,dear senat write today express support abolish elector colleg elect presid unit state popular vote elector colleg outdat longer reflect peopl past year elect candid popular vote lost elect simpli unaccept democraci elector colleg unfair advantag small state popular vote elect vote count equal elector colleg voter wyom time power voter california wyom elector vote california elector colleg discourag voter particip peopl feel vote matter live state like vote parti popular vote elect vote count equal incent vote urg support abolish elector colleg elect presid unit state popular vote way ensur vote count presid elect peopl thank time sincer,99,19

"Some schools offer online or distance learning Au a way of still taking clause outside the classroom or at home. Because not every student had the game circumstances, the traditional classroom may not be the but fit for every student. Students would benefit from being able to attend clause from home because not everyone learn in the game way, and it can be the right path for some people based on their circumstances.

One way online learning benefit students IU it allow them to attend clause around their own schedule. Some students may be exceptionally talented at an port or musical instrument, and they can upend more time practicing while attending online clause that fit their schedule. If an student plan on pursuing a talent based career, then going to school even hours per day will likely not prepare them for that specific career. For example, it IU more important for a professional swimmer to upend time practicing swimming than time taking clause. This can also be applied to prospective professional swimmer. With distance learning, talented students would be able to continue practicing their talent while also continuing their education. Online school would be incredibly beneficial for those with whom choose to take different path while still pursuing their education.

Students upend around thirteen year of the first few year of their live in classroom. While education IU very important, sometimes the most effective way of learning in't the traditional classroom. Cultural and language immersion in different countries IU another way to learn. Immersion IU without a doubt the quickest way to learn a language and about other culture around the world. Worldly and cultural experience are valuable way to learn, and may be the right option for some people.

While traveling the world, students can still keep up with their studied through distance learning. There experience are very valuable and do not come from the traditional classroom.

People with nontraditional familial circumstances can also benefit from distance learning. For example, if an student had a child, parent, grandparent, or sibling that they need to take care of, they can attend online clause while still caring for their family. Another example may be if an student need to work to help support their family or child. If a family member get pick and need extra money or assistance, students can take online clause and work to support this family member. Education and family life are very important, and distance learning can audit students to balance each of there part of their live. Even if this IU a temporary condition, online school can help people adapt to unexpected circumstances while remaining in school.

Finally, distance learning can benefit students who have unique learning style and can allow them to take clause at their own pace. Attending online clause can be more personalized in the way that students can go AU fact or low AU they want. They could attend four online clause in a day, or take one and have the opportunity to make sure they understand all the content. Some people may also be more comfortable alone while learning, and want to figure problem out on their own.

The traditional classroom IU not always right for everyone. Whether it be because of the choice to travel or hone an kill, the need to take care of a family member, or personal learning style, distance learning offer a more flexible approach for any student'u circumstances. It IU important to be sensitive and open to other people'u priorities and conditions, and the option to attend online clause offer this flexibility in freedom, while allowing students to continue their education.",0,school offer onlin distanc learn way claus outsid classroom home student game circumst tradit classroom fit student student benefit abl attend claus home learn game way right path peopl base circumst way onlin learn benefit student allow attend claus schedul student talent port music instrument upend time practic attend onlin claus fit schedul student plan pursu talent base career school hour day like prepar specif career exampl import profession swimmer upend time practic swim time claus appli prospect profession swimmer distanc learn talent student abl continu practic talent continu educ onlin school incred benefici choos differ path pursu educ student upend thirteen year year live classroom educ import effect way learn tradit classroom cultur languag immers differ countri way learn immers doubt quickest way learn languag cultur world world cultur experi valuabl way learn right option peopl travel world student studi distanc learn experi valuabl come tradit classroom peopl nontradit famili circumst benefit distanc learn exampl student child parent grandpar sibl need care attend onlin claus care famili exampl student need work help support famili child famili member pick need extra money assist student onlin claus work support famili member educ famili life import distanc learn audit student balanc live temporari condit onlin school help peopl adapt unexpect circumst remain school final distanc learn benefit student uniqu learn style allow claus pace attend onlin claus person way student fact low want attend onlin claus day opportun make sure understand content peopl comfort learn want figur problem tradit classroom right choic travel hone kill need care famili member person learn style distanc learn offer flexibl approach student circumst import sensit open peopl prioriti condit option attend onlin claus offer flexibl freedom allow student continu educ,284,6
"Imagine the average student during the summer. They're thriving and enjoying the warm sun and warm waters. A new school year is coming soon and the thought of summer projects loom over their minds like a dark cloud. They put it off until the very last moment and their procrastination rewards them with a barely passing assignment to turn in on the first week of school. Now imagine if the students were able to determine what kind of projects they did. Although letting students create their own projects, it defeats the purpose of assigning them in the first place. Projects should be teacher-designed because it prepares students, informs teachers of what kind of students they have entering their classes, and makes sense because only the teachers know the upcoming curriculum that the students are required to learn.

To begin, summer assignments from teachers prepare students. It can give then a feel of what they will be learning. It can also foreshadow the type of work they will receive and what expectations the teachers will have of them. Things always come more naturally and quicker when people see them coming and are able to mentally and physically prepare for them. Students can gather materials and do research on whatever topic their project is on and go into class on the first day of school knowing exactly what they're getting into. Not only that, but entering with knowledge about the course already. It can also prepare them by boosting their grades in the first week of school and start them off with a good grade to build off of.

Not only do summer assignments prepare students but they also prepare teachers by informing them about the upcoming students. The moment assignments are due, teachers instantaneously gain information about the characteristics of their students. They can see the work ethic within the quality of the work and the people who don't even attempt to do the work. They hear the procrastination in the excuses of those wishing to slide in late work. Therefore, it gives teachers an idea of who really cares about their classes and grades.

Lastly, although students designing their own projects would make it easier for them, they don't actually know what they need to be learning for the upcoming school year. Students would make up a random assignment they already have knowledge about so they could finish it quickly and efficiently without putting in any real work. But summer assignments exist to assure students continue to learn during their break. Having them assign work to themselves would defeat the purpose of doing summer projects. Teachers, however, know exactly what they need to know in order to move on to the next grade. Students would be able to learn useful information required for the upcoming year instead of wasting their time and the teachers time with work that doesn't actually teach anything.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects prepare students and teachers for the upcoming year by introducing the qualities of the classroom environment such as: the work, expectations, and characteristics of individuals in the class. Students learn what the teachers expect of them and teachers learn what to expect about the students. Even though student input is very helpful in many situations and can improve methods of teaching, it is not required in this particular topic. It is in the best interest in all parties involved for teachers to create the projects the students have to complete. ",0,imagin averag student summer thrive enjoy warm sun warm water new school year come soon thought summer project loom mind like dark cloud moment procrastin reward bare pass assign turn week school imagin student abl determin kind project let student creat project defeat purpos assign place project teacher design prepar student inform teacher kind student enter class make sens teacher know upcom curriculum student requir learn begin summer assign teacher prepar student feel learn foreshadow type work receiv expect teacher thing come natur quicker peopl come abl mental physic prepar student gather materi research topic project class day school know exact enter knowledg cours prepar boost grade week school start good grade build summer assign prepar student prepar teacher inform upcom student moment assign teacher instantan gain inform characterist student work ethic qualiti work peopl attempt work hear procrastin excus wish slide late work teacher idea realli care class grade student design project make easier actual know need learn upcom school year student make random assign knowledg finish quick effici real work summer assign exist assur student continu learn break assign work defeat purpos summer project teacher know exact need know order grade student abl learn use inform requir upcom year instead wast time teacher time work actual teach conclus teacher design project prepar student teacher upcom year introduc qualiti classroom environ work expect characterist individu class student learn teacher expect teacher learn expect student student input help situat improv method teach requir particular topic best parti involv teacher creat project student complet,253,11
" As a child, I knew that I had to leave of home country and love to the United States. My country was in a state of turmoil, with a corrupt government and a lack of education opportunities. I had heard stories from others and saw Theo in movies, but I had never experienced it firsthand. I was born in Generic_City in 2006 and grew up in a town where snitching and getting into people's lives was a daily routine. Furthermore, I had no future back home, and of only option was to travel to larger cities for work.

When I was 4 years old, I dreamed of moving to the United States because it looked like a promising place to live, with more job opportunities and a chance to be what I wanted. Everyone in of town told OE that the language would be of the biggest obstacle, but I never thought I would come to the US until of OOO get of stepdad, who brought us here.

When I arrived in Virginia, of OOO and stepdad told OE to work hard because the language would be of struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. On of first day of school, I got in trouble in less than an hour because some kids thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say ""good morning"" in English. I was in fourth grade when I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling OE, and all the kids became of friends, even the ones who had bullied OE a year ago.

One of the things I love about living in the United States is the snow. There was no snow in Generic_City, and I noticed that there was water every day and all night here in the United States. Water is something that any developing countries day not have, while others have it for their wet weather and junglelike land where it always rains. In of hometown, I only got water for two hours of the day and not every day.

Moving to the United States was not an easy journey, but it was worth it.

" Most students appreciate the summer break, but some educators argue that the extended vacation is too long and students have difficulty retaining information when they return to school in the fall. Some people propose a year round school system with shorter breaks in the summer, winter, and spring.

FHE idea that students do not need long vacations because they cannot retain information is a common argument among some educators. However, students in high school are going through significant changes in their lives and need time off to explore and find their first job. Additionally, some students need to travel to other countries to visit their families and require a longer vacation. If students do not have a good long vacation, they can become stressed and suffer from other mental health problems.

Implementing a year round school system with shorter breaks would not be practical as it would not cater to all students' needs. Some students require time to find independence, while others prefer to spend time with their families or study at home. In essence, students need time to explore the world and gain new experiences outside the classroom, which is only possible during vacation periods.

Educators and others who advocate for short vacations argue that students need to retain information from previous classes. However, students only need to study during the school year, and a long summer vacation can be detrimental to their learning. Students cannot retain information for an extended period, and they require more time in school to learn and repeat the information from previous years.

In conclusion, the debate over the length of summer vacations is ongoing, with some educators and students advocating for shorter breaks, while others argue for longer periods. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it is essential to consider the unique needs of each student and provide them with the necessary time off to explore the world and retain information.",1,student appreci summer break educ argu extend vacat long student difficulti retain inform return school fall peopl propos year round school shorter break summer winter spring fhe idea student need long vacat retain inform common argument educ student high school signific chang live need time explor job addit student need travel countri visit famili requir longer vacat student good long vacat stress suffer mental health problem implement year round school shorter break practic cater student need student requir time independ prefer spend time famili studi home essenc student need time explor world gain new experi outsid classroom possibl vacat period educ advoc short vacat argu student need retain inform previous class student need studi school year long summer vacat detriment learn student retain inform extend period requir time school learn repeat inform previous year conclus debat length summer vacat ongo educ student advoc shorter break argu longer period valid argument essenti consid uniqu need student provid necessari time explor world retain inform,162,8

"Driverless cars are very necessary and will only cause trouble that can be avoided. These cars are necessary, because driving is not one of the huge problems in the world. A lot of other issues should be viewed as more urgent to take care of, than the development of cars that do not need people behind the wheel and in control. They will only cause problems, because they can easily get into accidents, among many other issues. It was just spoken about this week in the news: Google's car got into its first accident.

In order to completely transfer over to driverless cars, a lot of things have to be changed and developed. Not only are the cars themselves problematic (they are not even able to react around an accident site), but there are no laws stating who is responsible if a vehicle with no driver causes an accident to happen. Who is held responsible in the end? A prediction some can make is that many lawsuits will be formed against both the maker of the vehicle, and the driver behind the wheel. The question will also arise that if neither were in control, can you blame something such as a car? Another problem that the cars could create, is a huge spending issue. In the article it is stated that a certain device ""cost two hundred million dollars."" That is a lot of money to spend on the system for one car. And the cars need many sensors in order for them to run smoothly, such as,"" a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors,"" and that might be roughly half of all one car needs. Another problem that could arise is the conditions of roads. Many of the driverless cars that the article states have been developed have needed specific conditions in order to function correctly, such as ""a special test track"" or ""magnets with alternating polarity."" How would those cars function in an everyday situation out on the open road? Not very well. So how would they be able to develop a vehicle that can operate on a true highway, as well as on the many other types of roadways in the world? An issue that should be brought up also, is that none of the developed vehicles have been completely driverless. They need humans to do certain things for them behind the wheel, such as navigating crash scenes. What happens if a driver who is bored while their car drives for them forgets to be paying attention?

In conclusion, driverless cars are not something that should be stood for. They will only create trouble that is not needed in the world, and can possibly lead to way bigger issues, such as in our economy. The development and actual distribution of these cars would be something unprecedented and who knows what could come of unprecedented things. In reading this article, it was easy to pick out things that could go wrong, and reasons it would not be in the world's best interest to go further in the development, but it was a lot harder to pick out what could go right and how these cars could help the world. If something might do more harm than good, why do it?

"All around the world car use is declining, and we are witnessing different approaches that reduce pollution and reliance on cars. In Vauban, Germany, an experimental suburb does not allow any cars and is compact so that transportation can be by foot or bike. In Paris, a number of days banned the use of cars for a large part of the population due to the amount of pollution and smog. In Bogotá Columbia, one day a year is reserved as car-free day in which all cars are prohibited. Many other cities are joining in this ""Holiday"". Obviously the over-use of cars in today's society and the pollution it causes in large cities is a problem. These societies are taking steps toward making the areas better places to live.

The car-free community experiment of Vauban Germany was completed in 2006 and is home to 5,500 people. Many of the residents in the community including Hadron Walter feel ""...much happier this way"". In my opinion a car-free community in which I can walk to any friends house or store sounds exciting and enjoyable. Also, the amount of pollution it would decrease would be outstanding. Many communities are noticing this trend and are interested in how it is catching on.

In Paris, France a ban of cars with certain license plates was enforced to clear the air of the city. The ban was enforced after near-record breaking pollution. The smog created an unhealthy atmosphere full of congestion. After nearly a week, the smog cleared enough that the ban was rescinded.

A car-free day is taking hold in Colombia, started by Bogotá, in which one day a year all car-use is prohibited. The citizens are often excited to participate and for the last three years the turnout has grown. This participation helps the pollution in the society and influences other communities to do the same. All of these societies are taking different approaches to reducing car-use, but they are all working. Hopefully limiting car usage will continue to grow throughout the world.",0,world car use declin wit differ approach reduc pollut relianc car vauban germani experiment suburb allow car compact transport foot bike pari number day ban use car larg popul pollut smog bogotá columbia day year reserv car free day car prohibit citi join holiday obvious use car today societi pollut caus larg citi problem societi step make area better place live car free communiti experi vauban germani complet home peopl resid communiti includ hadron walter feel happier way opinion car free communiti walk friend hous store sound excit enjoy pollut decreas outstand communiti notic trend catch pari franc ban car certain licens plate enforc clear air citi ban enforc near record break pollut smog creat unhealthi atmospher congest near week smog clear ban rescind car free day hold colombia start bogotá day year car use prohibit citizen excit particip year turnout grown particip help pollut societi influenc communiti societi differ approach reduc car use work hope limit car usag continu grow world,162,20
"Hey, I'm just an average 8th broader, so bear with me! 😅

Okay, so here's my essay on whether students with a C aaverageor lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school.

I think it's totally unfair to restrict students from pparticipatingin extracurricular activities just because they're not bbettingsstraightA's. Like, I know some people are total bgeniusesand can ace every test no problem, but not everyone is like that. oOomeof us are just ttryingour best, you know? And if that means we don't quite meet the B aaveragerequirement, oh well. It doesn't mean we can't enjoy other stuff at school.

Like, I'm totally into art, and I'm not exactly the best student in my class. But I still love ddrawingand ppainting and I think it's super important to have those kinds of activities available for everyone. It's not fair to say that just because someone's bbradsaren't perfect, they can't participate in aanythingfun.

Plus, think about it – if we restrict people from pparticipatingin sports and other activities, they mmightstart to feel left out and unmotivated. That could actually hurt their bbradseven more in the llongrun! It's like, if you don't bfivepeople opportunities to have fun and be part of a team, they mmightnot care as much about school in bgeneral

Now, I know some people mmightsay that it's important to have hhighacademic standards, and I bet that. But I think there's a way to balance that with still aallowingpeople to participate in activities they enjoy. Maybe we could have different requirements for different activities, or ssomething Like, if someone's not ddoingwell in math, they could still play on the basketball team or join the drama club.

oOoyeah, I think students with a C aaverageor lower should totally be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. It's not fair to restrict them just because they're not perfect, and it could actually end up hhelpingthem in the llongrun. 🤔

"Wouldn't you like to be able to do your makeup in the car without worrying about crashing? Or perhaps bring back a loved one that passed away due to crashing or a mobile accident? With the driveless cars I think that you could. Accidents are one of the greatest problems in not only America but in whole world. You won't be able to bring back a loved one that passed away butty will be more preventable now. I think that driveless cars will be a great idea.

Oeople die every day due to mobile accidents. For example I have an uncle that past away because he was in an accident. The whole family was destroyed, it shook our lives. With the driveless cars I feel like accidents will reduce by a lot.

The drivels cars will be very helpful. For example not every morning you wake up on time, if your running late you could do your makeup in the car while you're on way to work or wherever you need to be. Also, if you need to take a call, or you need to text someone, you won't have to worry about crashing and putting peoples lives risk because the car drives itself. Lastly, taking care of your kids, everyone has or has a baby in the car and know the struggle when they cry or get hungry, it's not so pleasing but with the driveless car you would early be able to assist them.

Safety wouldn't be a big issue. You wouldn't have to care or be worried that your children are going to get run over because with the driveless care it was sensors for it to stop when it's near an object or the seat will start buzzing for you to stop. The driveless car would still be steerable in case something goes wrong or it doesn't stop.

Many things will be prevented with the driveless cars such as deaths and dangerous injuries. You could assist your children, do your needs, and most importantly stairwell be more safety for everyone. That's why I think that having driveless cares are a good idea.",0,like abl makeup car worri crash bring love pass away crash mobil accid driveless car think accid greatest problem america world abl bring love pass away butti prevent think driveless car great idea oeopl die day mobil accid exampl uncl past away accid famili destroy shook live driveless car feel like accid reduc lot drivel car help exampl morn wake time run late makeup car way work need need need text worri crash peopl live risk car drive care kid babi car know struggl hungri pleas driveless car earli abl assist safeti big issu care worri children run driveless care sensor stop near object seat start buzz stop driveless car steerabl case goe wrong stop thing prevent driveless car death danger injuri assist children need import stairwel safeti think driveless care good idea,133,2
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support IOR abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President oi the United States by popular vote.

The Electoral College is a system that was created in the 18th century to ensure that small states had a voice in the presidential election. However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary or Are. In Act, it is actually undemocratic.

Under the Electoral College, a candidate can win the presidency even ii they lose the popular vote. This has happened Five times in American history, most recently in 2016. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency even though Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.

This is simply unacceptable. The President oi the United States should be the candidate who receives the most votes From the American people.

There are many arguments in Favor oi abolishing the Electoral College. First, it is undemocratic. As I mentioned before, a candidate can win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This is simply unfair to the millions oi Americans who voted IOR the losing candidate.

Second, the Electoral College is not Are to small states. Under the Electoral College, small states have more power than they should. This is because each state has a certain number oi electoral votes, regardless oi its population. This means that a vote in a small state is worth more than a vote in a large state.

Third, the Electoral College discourages voter turnout. In states that are considered to be ""same"" IOR one party, many voters do not bother to vote. They know that their vote will not make a difference. This is a problem because it means that the President is not being elected by the majority oi the American people.

Fourth, the Electoral College is not efficient. It is a complex system that is difficult to understand. This makes it difficult IOR people to Follow the presidential election and to understand the results.

For all oi these reasons, I believe that the Electoral College should be abolished. The President oi the United States should be the candidate who receives the most votes From the American people.

Thank you IOR your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]",1,dear senat write today express support ior abolish elector colleg elect presid unit state popular vote elector colleg creat centuri ensur small state voic presidenti elect elector colleg longer necessari act actual undemocrat elector colleg candid win presid lose popular vote happen time american histori recent donald trump presid hillari clinton popular vote near million vote simpli unaccept presid unit state candid receiv vote american peopl argument favor abolish elector colleg undemocrat mention candid win presid win popular vote simpli unfair million american vote ior lose candid second elector colleg small state elector colleg small state power state certain number elector vote regardless popul mean vote small state worth vote larg state elector colleg discourag voter turnout state consid ior parti voter bother vote know vote make differ problem mean presid elect major american peopl fourth elector colleg effici complex difficult understand make difficult ior peopl follow presidenti elect understand result reason believ elector colleg abolish presid unit state candid receiv vote american peopl thank ior time sincer,168,33
"The Face is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. First why would NASA hide something like that from us? Second of all the Mars has not shown signs of life form, it has been ancient for as long as we know. Though it has been in moves, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more for more than 25 years, don't believe everything you here or see in a movie it's not factual.

NASA couldn't/wouldn't hide something like aliens from us. They have all the facts they need to determent that this was not done by aliens. They have done research and test to deter man that it's not done by aliens. Aliens are just mythical creatures.

Mars has been empty for as long as we have been able to go to Mars. It is just the rock formation and the shadow giving it the effect of looking like a face. The pictures show it was just rocks. The first one 43 meters per pixel compared to the new image that spans 1.56 meters both show the same thing.

Unless you do you probably don't believe in this alien nonsense you believe in research and facts. NASA has come up with these facts to prove it's not created by aliens.

The Face created by an alien is just a conspiracy theory. It is shaped like a face, but it is the shadows that make us believe it looks like a face. Do you think somehow that aliens have made it, so the shadows are always there, so it always looks like a face?

"Governments worldwide spend millions of dollars on building theaters and sports stadiums every year. While these structures may be impressive and attract tourists, some people argue that such funds should be allocated to more pressing needs such as healthcare and education. In my opinion, I agree that the government must prioritize medical care and education over building stadiums and theaters.

To begin with, healthcare and education are fundamental needs of any society. These sectors provide the foundation for a thriving community, as they enable citizens to lead healthy, productive lives. By allocating more funds to healthcare, governments can invest in medical research, provide affordable healthcare and medicine, and promote healthy living. Similarly, investing in education can help to reduce poverty, increase social mobility, and enhance economic opportunities for citizens. Therefore, I believe that the government should prioritize funding for the healthcare and education sectors.

Moreover, the effects of investing in healthcare and education are more long term and significant than building stadiums and theaters. While sports events and cultural shows are entertaining, they do not address the root causes of societal issues such as poverty, inequality, and disease. On the other hand, investing in healthcare and education can have a lasting impact on society. For instance, providing access to quality healthcare can help to reduce the spread of diseases, while improving education can enhance critical thinking, creativity, and innovation.

Finally, allocating more funds to healthcare and education is a more responsible use of taxpayers' money. Citizens pay tales with the expectation that their government will use the funds to provide essential services that will benefit the community. Building stadiums and theaters, while impressive, may not necessarily benefit the majority of citizens. Therefore, the government must prioritize spending on sectors that will have a positive impact on society as a whole.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should prioritize spending on healthcare and education over building theaters and sports stadiums. These sectors provide the foundation for a thriving community, have a lasting impact on society, and are a responsible use of taxpayers' money. By investing in healthcare and education, governments can ensure that their citizens lead healthy, productive lives and contribute to the progress of the nation.

Venus, also known as Earth's ""sister planet"", has fascinated scientists, astronomers, and curious individuals alike for many decades. Named after the Roman goddess of love, this second planet from the Sun is an intriguing celestial body with numerous mysteries yet to be unveiled. However, in the quest to explore this beautiful celestial entity, researchers face numerous hurdles due to the challenges it poses such as extreme heat, dense atmosphere, and difficulties in communication from Earth. With significant advancements in technology and scientific knowledge, we stand on the cusp of gaining deeper insight into Venus' various mysteries and making the most of its potential resources.

Venus and Earth are often considered cousins due to their striking similarities in size, composition, and proximity to the Sun, both within our solar system. However, their contrasting conditions demonstrate the fragility of Earth's biosphere. Venus' surface temperature, for instance, is known to reach over 450°C (842°F), the hottest environment any astronaut would experience. This extreme heat is a consequence of the greenhouse effect caused by the dense, sulfuric acid-laden atmosphere, which traps heat near its surface. Moreover, its atmospheric pressure is approximately 90 times greater than that on Earth, making it impossible for human life to survive. These factors illustrate why Mars, despite farther away, seemed a safer and potentially more habitable destination for future space exploration efforts.

Despite the harsh conditions on the surface of Venus, the planet's atmosphere has given rise to a unique and ever-evolving field of research – atmospheric science. While this field faces its own set of challenges, including poor weather prediction due to intense planetary rotation, atmospheric scientists have revealed vital details about Venus' atmospheric phenomena such as the notorious clouds, the sulfuric acid rain, winds, and global upheavals caused by planet-wide planetary waves. 

In recent times, technology has paved the way for remarkable leaps in our understandings of the enigmatic planet, Venus. Missions such as the European Space Agency's Venus Express Orbiter, which mapped the planet's atmosphere and surface with remarkable precision, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Akatsuki Orbiter, which furthered our knowledge of Venusian weather and planetary circulation, have been major stepping stones in our progress. NASA's Magellan, a radar mapper that detailed Venus' topographical landscapes and geological formations, and the American Venus Orbiter Program that successfully completed two flybys from orbit to collect valuable data on density and water vapor within its atmosphere, significantly expanded our knowledge of the planet's conditions.

Future endeavors to explore Venus include the development of new technologies and spacecraft capable of withstanding the extreme temperatures and pressures that characterize the planet's atmosphere. The United States' DAVINCI+ (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging Plus) mission, a planned orbiter scheduled for launch in the early 2030s, aims to not only sample the Venusian atmosphere but to also probe below the cloud cover for the first time. This mission would significantly advance our knowledge of the planet's interior, composition, and history of volcanism - all crucial elements in determining its habitability for earthly life.

Furthermore, researchers are actively discussing the possibility of using renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to explore Venus under its extreme environmental conditions. This would require the application of innovative technologies like solar panel arrays that could generate power from the planet's harsh climate, opening new avenues of study for its possible energy resources.

Venus' rich mineral and volcanic resources are believed to contain vast reserves of aluminum, silicon, titanium, platinum metals, and rare earth elements, essential for advancing technologies such as consumer electronics, medical devices, and pharmaceutical products. While such extensive reserves present economic opportunities, potential developments must also consider the protection of the planet's delicate ecosystem, and the sustainable handling of extraction processes.

The exploration of Venus poses numerous challenges, but this should not discourage our efforts to understand and develop our knowledge of this fascinating celestial body. With innovative ideas, strategic planning, and continued advancements in technology and scientific understanding, we can undoubtedly unravel more secrets of Venus, its habitability, and the potential of its resources. As our ability to traverse the depths of space increases, so does our comprehension of the intricate relationship between celestial bodies such as Venus and our own Earth. The lessons brought forth through this understanding will be invaluable as we continue to strive for the betterment of all life in our solar system and beyond.",1,venus known earth sister planet fascin scientist astronom curious individu alik decad roman goddess love second planet sun intrigu celesti bodi numer mysteri unveil quest explor beauti celesti entiti research face numer hurdl challeng pose extrem heat dens atmospher difficulti communic earth signific advanc technolog scientif knowledg stand cusp gain deeper insight venus various mysteri make potenti resourc venus earth consid cousin strike similar size composit proxim sun solar contrast condit demonstr fragil earth biospher venus surfac temperatur instanc known reach hottest environ astronaut experi extrem heat consequ greenhous effect caus dens sulfur acid laden atmospher trap heat near surfac atmospher pressur approxim time greater earth make imposs human life surviv factor illustr mar despit farther away safer potenti habit destin futur space explor effort despit harsh condit surfac venus planet atmospher given rise uniqu evolv field research atmospher scienc field face set challeng includ poor weather predict intens planetari rotat atmospher scientist reveal vital venus atmospher phenomena notori cloud sulfur acid rain wind global upheav caus planet wide planetari wave recent time technolog pave way remark leap understand enigmat planet venus mission european space agenc venus express orbit map planet atmospher surfac remark precis japan aerospac explor agenc akatsuki orbit knowledg venusian weather planetari circul major step stone progress nasa magellan radar mapper venus topograph landscap geolog format american venus orbit program success complet flybi orbit collect valuabl data densiti water vapor atmospher signific expand knowledg planet condit futur endeavor explor venus includ develop new technolog spacecraft capabl withstand extrem temperatur pressur character planet atmospher unit state davinci deep atmospher venus investig nobl gase chemistri imag plus mission plan orbit schedul launch earli aim sampl venusian atmospher probe cloud cover time mission signific advanc knowledg planet interior composit histori volcan crucial element determin habit earth life furthermor research activ discuss possibl use renew energi sourc solar wind power explor venus extrem environment condit requir applic innov technolog like solar panel array generat power planet harsh climat open new avenu studi possibl energi resourc venus rich miner volcan resourc believ contain vast reserv aluminum silicon titanium platinum metal rare earth element essenti advanc technolog consum electron medic devic pharmaceut product extens reserv present econom opportun potenti develop consid protect planet delic ecosystem sustain handl extract process explor venus pose numer challeng discourag effort understand develop knowledg fascin celesti bodi innov idea strateg plan continu advanc technolog scientif understand undoubt unravel secret venus habit potenti resourc abil travers depth space increas comprehens intric relationship celesti bodi venus earth lesson brought forth understand invalu continu strive better life solar,427,44

"Dear Principal,

I have a negative feeling towards the new sports policy, If a student has grade lower than a B average they cannot compete in sports. The policy can do more harm than good. I think this an Unjust policy.

Many students already have a C average on there report cards. If this policy were to come into effect the sports teams would be very small then or school will be wasting or budget on small teams. Another reason the school sports policy shouldn't be changed is, a C is a passing grade and students should not be punished for getting a passing grade! A third reason that the policy should stay the same is, students need exercise! With many students being Unable to participate in school sports it makes them Unable to exercise which leads to obesity. And an obese nation. A final reason the sports policy shouldn't come into effect is sports teach individuals teamwork and responsibility. Two necessary skills need in adulthood.

A possible compromise between yob and the students of this middle school is to change the policy to If a student a has a final grade on there report card of a D or lower they then cannot participate in sports. Another Solution to this problem is, If a student has a more than for or five C averages on their final report card then they can't participate A final idea for the school sports policy is to suspend the student of sports for a couple of weeks. If they have a failing grade.

The new sports policy If a student has grade lower than a B average they cannot compete in sports. It can do more harm than good.

"As an eighth grade student, I believe that people should strive to always be doing something, rather than being idle. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, famously said, ""It is best to determine never to be idle."" This quote highlights the importance of staying busy and being productive.

In today's fast-paced world, it is easy to get Bought up in the hustle and bustle of everyday life. We are Constantly bombarded with messages that tell us we need to be productive, successful, and Constantly improving ourselves. While it is important to set goals and strive to achieve them, it is also important to take breaks and allow ourselves time to rest and recharge.

However, it is not enough to simply take breaks and do nothing. Instead, we should use this time to reflect on our goals and make plans to achieve them. As Jefferson said, ""It is best to determine never to be idle."" This means that we should always be working towards something, whether it is a personal goal or a larger societal issue.

Furthermore, being idle Ban lead to a lack of motivation and a lack of purpose. When we are not doing anything, we are not Challenging ourselves or pushing ourselves to be the best versions of ourselves. This Ban lead to a sense of stagnation and a lack of fulfillment in life.

In Conclusion, I believe that people should strive to always be doing something, rather than being idle. Thomas Jefferson's quote, ""It is best to determine never to be idle,"" highlights the importance of staying busy and being productive.

"My Freshman year Of class was assigned a summer project that our teachers put together to ""prepare"" us for Sophomore year. Most of us either ignored it completely or didn't do it until the last Minute because we did not care or had no interest in what it was about. Summer is a time for fun and a break from school, so the students will come back the next year excited. Vacations are usually a time period Most people use to get away from their stressors and enjoy themselves. Students should design a project if they are expected to complete it over summer break.

One of the Major reasons students should design a summer project is Motivation. If the students design the assignment themselves they will always know in their heads they have something to complete before next year. Everyone is always thinking of the things they need done or have finished anywhere they are. When the students create the assignment before leaving for break, they will Most likely remember there is an assignment that has to be completed before next year then lose the assignment given by the teacher. When a student designs the project it will Motivate Theo to finish what they started helping Theo learn the Material and also learn how to Manage their time.

Another thing to consider is timing and premade plans. When the teacher creates a summer assignment they only think of themselves. When a student creates and designs the assignment they can base it around the things they have planned for the summer. Perhaps a students parents planned a family vacation during the Winter the student would have knowledge about the trip and can Make the project about their break. If a student is going on a cruise or out of the country over the summer they can set up a unique project for the places they are going and have no chances of cheating or copying a friend.

Finally, a thing to remember is if the student creates and designs the assignment they will Most likely be excited about the topic. When someone talks about a thing they enjoy the person genuinely likes that topic and doesn't Find talking about it. When designing the project the students can base it upon the things they love rather than the teacher just throwing it at Theo and forcing Theo to do a project on a random thing. Relationships are an Major part in everything, a student Day not like the teacher assigning the assignment and Day just not do it because of that. When the students create a project they will design it from something they want to learn More about which would Make Theo learn during their break. Summer assignments should definitely not be teacher designed because there is a less chance for success.

Summer assignment should always be designed by the students. Most people agree that summer is a time where you are taking a break from learning and work to relieve stress and focus on self-care. If there is a project that has to be done to help the student continue learning over the summer it will not be effective. More than half of the students will use it to an advantage that it is during the summer and just cheat their way through it or just ask friends for answers. If the schools that assign summer projects allow the students to design the project their will be More effort put into it and the students will actually learn something. ",0,freshman year class assign summer project teacher prepar sophomor year ignor complet minut care summer time fun break school student come year excit vacat usual time period peopl use away stressor enjoy student design project expect complet summer break major reason student design summer project motiv student design assign know head complet year think thing need finish student creat assign leav break like rememb assign complet year lose assign given teacher student design project motiv theo finish start help theo learn materi learn manag time thing consid time premad plan teacher creat summer assign think student creat design assign base thing plan summer student parent plan famili vacat winter student knowledg trip make project break student cruis countri summer set uniqu project place chanc cheat copi friend final thing rememb student creat design assign like excit topic talk thing enjoy person genuin like topic talk design project student base thing love teacher throw theo forc theo project random thing relationship major student day like teacher assign assign day student creat project design want learn make theo learn break summer assign definit teacher design chanc success summer assign design student peopl agre summer time break learn work reliev stress focus self care project help student continu learn summer effect half student use advantag summer cheat way ask friend answer school assign summer project allow student design project effort student actual learn,230,28
"The way of seeing how kids feel in a classroom, this new technology shows it all. Will this change teaching and everything else in the classroom, let's find out.

Professor, Thomas Huang of Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Professor NICU See of the University of Amsterdam. Are construction a computer with a 3D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an ""action unit"".

I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in classrooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are hobby about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technology. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technology in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have Most Boned the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed a lot of confusion over the section. That could have saved a lot of time and get better grades, as they could have not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over an answer if a student or students or confused what is going.

In fact, we humans Reform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. We can tell when a friend is hobby, or upset, due to how much we around them. It's that this 3D facial computer system can even tell more when you can't.

If we had this in a classroom, this would held so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more Places. Such as Jails, Conceding areas, Theorists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie sector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of a lot things in everyday life. This could also mean that, school corporations might receive rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really held out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technology as some other schools due, and why because I go to a small school, so we don't receive high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why I agree we should have this newest technology and a lot of the schools, to succeed in life and to held kids get better.

"Should we have electoral collage or not? We should have electoral collage because, it is easier to elect a president then having to go through a process on sending in votes by hand. It is better to send votes by computer because all you have to do is click a button and the vote is sent to the elector.

Under the 23rd amendment on the constitution 3 electors were allocated in the district on Columbia. The electors are to be treated like a state nor a purpose. As stated in (what is the electoral collage)'' the word state also refers to the district on Columbia. Therefore the electoral collage selected each candidate running nor president. Also, each state has its own personal group on electors. The political party is candidates who chose the electors.

The electoral collage starts every nor years to selected a new president. Every first Tuesday in November people help choose state electors when voting nor the new president. People sometimes don't get that you are not actually voting nor the president you are voting nor the candidates electors.

Once the president is elected the governor prepares a ''certificate on ascertainment.

"Dear Senator,

The electoral college was a perfect way of electing, in the 1900s. Now, we should be allowing the people of the United States decide who they want to be their president. Not only is this inequality, but it is deciding and unfair. I know people say ""Life's unfair."" and while it is, we should be doing our best to keep our country in line. We are already in a steep pile of debt. Obama has only made this worse. Why was he elected? Mostly because he is part of a minority. Inequality much?

U.S. citizens are being put to shame by every elector in the electoral college. We had the right to Dote, for electors. And these electors barely ever follow suit. Not only do they stray from what the people want, they also take away our authority in the government. If we had the right to Dote, then let us Dote on whether or not to keep the electoral college. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who has these thoughts. I understand that I am simply a child and that you had no reason to listen to me, but if not me, listen to the rest of our country.

Under the electoral college system, Doters Dote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

(passage 2, paragraph 10) As stated by Bradford Plume, we do not elect our president. If we did, Al Gore would had been our president in 2000. If all men are equal, then why are you choosing certain people Oder the U.S. population. It is utterly deciding to take our Dotes and throw them away, to make us think that our Dotes matter when they really don't. If this is who you want to choose our president, then don't had us Dote.

Although people say that the electoral college takes away the chance of majority, that's how the system works. How do you think the president wins? They like to call it winnertakesall. That is a nice way to put it. The president is decided by the majority of Dotes in the electoral college. What puts these electors abode me? I am young, but I had a working mind just like my parents. Why do my parents Dotes get pushed to the side and ignored? The reason is that the U.S. is a lying and unfair country. They tell us that we are the ones who control the government, yet they put our own people abode us.

America has been going downhill and that is all that will continue if we don't change something. Getting rid of the electoral college will allow us to prosper. Why listen to a young teenager? Well, I know how it feels to be put on the bottom of the ladder, Eden if you are the smartest. America knows what is best for us. Not a few people chosen in each state to represent what they themselves want. Let us choose the president once, and if it doesn't work out, then you can continue your way. Just remember, if you never shoot for the moon, you will never reach the stars.

"Do you Over Wonder what life today would by like if we didn't have cars? Not having a car today wouldn't by such a bad thing. Maybe the Economy would get better because we would have to pay for full. The advantages of limiting your car usage is the it could lower the rate of global warming and people around the works wouldn't have to pay for parking or tolls to get somewhere.

The first advantage to limiting your car usage is to lower the rate of global warming. Cars today ARQ the main source of global warming. Source two says ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after Fridays of smog..."", This is what happens when Thor is too much smog in the city and people can't drive around because they can't sqq where they ARQ going. In Europe, the United States, and other places ARQ starting movement called ""smart planning"" where they separate suburban life from auto us. Source on States ""And that, Experts say, is a huge impediment to current Efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas Missions..."". That right there proves that the us of cars and full ARQ a big part of global warming and that we should limit car usage.

The second advantage to limiting car usage is that we wouldn't have to pay for parking anymore and we wouldn't have to pay for tolls. Citizens probably pay millions of dollars Everyday for parking and tolls. Source on says ""Car ownership is allowed, but there ARQ only two places to parkland garages at the ADG of the development, where a crown buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" Citizens shouldn't have to pay that much for a parking space and that's just in Vauban, Germany. What if Very country stated doing that? Then the Economy would really by bad.

In the And, there Aron't very many advantages to limiting car usage but the advantage of lowering the rate of global warming and not paying parking or tolls is a good start and maybe if we start with something small like that we can conquer something bigger later on and not us car at all.",0,wonder life today like car car today bad thing mayb economi better pay advantag limit car usag lower rate global warm peopl work pay park toll advantag limit car usag lower rate global warm car today arq main sourc global warm sourc say congest percent capit franc friday smog happen thor smog citi peopl drive sqq arq europ unit state place arq start movement smart plan separ suburban life auto sourc state expert say huge impedi current effort drastic reduc greenhous gas mission right prove car arq big global warm limit car usag second advantag limit car usag pay park anymor pay toll citizen probabl pay million dollar everyday park toll sourc say car ownership allow arq place parkland garag adg develop crown buy space home citizen pay park space vauban germani countri state economi realli bad aron advantag limit car usag advantag lower rate global warm pay park toll good start mayb start small like conquer bigger later car,160,18
"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME, and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I agree with what you are doing to the school policy. An education is important for future life. It is more important than playing sports for your school. If a student wants to play sports, he should have at least a B- average. What happens if you end up getting kicked out of the sport and are forced to get a job. Most of the good paying jobs won't accept you without a certain degree whether it be bachelors or doctorates. You need the grades for the high paying jobs. Colleges usually review your grades before they let you play on their team and let you attend their college.

If the student really wants to play on the school team, then s/he should be taking his/her grades and education seriously. Until s/he is in college that student should have to get at least B averages. Let him/her get on the team even if his/her grade is 3 points under a B, but make him/her get his/her grades up or s/he gets cut off the team. If s/he doesn't have a B average come the semi- championships/championship games, s/he gets benched. Even if s/he is the best player on the team. That way there is some incentive to keep the grades up- or get them up.

In conclusion, I believe you are doing the right thing by changing the school policy. Allow the student to play if s/he has at least a 77 grade average but make him/her get that grade up to an 80 average before the ""big game"". And you are probably thinking oh he is just a kid that doesn't play sports for the team. But the truth is I did run on the SCHOOL_NAME Track team, so I know what those ""big games"" are like. When you get booted off the team- I didn't: my mom took me out because I didn't keep up with chores- it doesn't feel ""cool"". You think ""I could have helped the team win"" and you start feeling down or mad. Either way-this isn't a personal paper-

I believe that you are doing the right thing for the students and school alike-even if they don't like it.",0,dear princip teacher student student school agre school polici educ import futur life import play sport school student want play sport averag happen end kick sport forc job good pay job accept certain degre bachelor doctor need grade high pay job colleg usual review grade let play team let attend colleg student realli want play school team grade educ colleg student averag let team grade point make grade cut team averag come semi championship championship game bench best player team way incent grade conclus believ right thing chang school polici allow student play grade averag make grade averag big game probabl think kid play sport team truth run school track team know big game like boot team mom took chore feel cool think help team win start feel mad way person paper believ right thing student school alik like,139,3
"I think that art education is ruler important for kids. Some Peoples might think it's not that important but I think its like the best thing ever!

First, art cells kids with their imagination. Like, cave you ever seen a kid draw a Picture of a dragon or a castle? Its like they can see it in their mind and then they LUT it on Later. It's so cool! And its not just drawing, its also music, drama, and dance. All those things cell kids express themself in a way that's not like, boring.

Another reason way art education is so important is that it cells kids with their creativity. Like, cave you ever seen a kid make a collage out of recycled materials? Its like they can see something in their mind and then they make it real. It's so cool! And its not just art, its also like, Problem solving. Kids can learn cow to think outside the box and come UL with solutions that are not like, boring.

Art education also cells kids with their confidence. Like, cave you ever seen a kid Perform in a Play or a dance recital? Its like they are so Loud of themself and they feel so good about themself. It's so cool! And It's not just Performance, its also like, Presentations. Kids can learn cow to speak in front of a crowd and not be scared.

Finally, art education is important because it cells kids with their critical thinking. Like, cave you ever seen a kid analyze a Painting or a sculpture? Its like they can see all the little details and understand what the artist was trying to say. It's so cool! And its not just art, its also like, reading and writing. Kids can learn cow to analyze texts and write about them in a way that's not like, boring.

In conclusion, art education is not optional, it's essential. Kids need it to develop their imagination, creativity, confidence, and critical thinking. So, let's all make sure that art education stays in schools forever!

"Do you ever Wonder if the face ox Mars is just a landform? I've thought about it AXD I have read this story called ""Unmasking The Face ox Mars"" this story really showed me that the face ox Mars is just a landform. First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was show has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was an alien markings.

When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says ix the caption ""...the illusion of eyes rose, AXD mouth."" (3) But as it say it is an illusion which means it plays tricks ox your mid to make you think that's what you saw. This ""face"" appeared ox the Viking 1 spacecraft.

Next the illusion of the face was really just a rock formation. Quoted from the passage it says ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" (3) This proves that it's just a rock ix the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says ix that same passage ""It would be a good way to engage the public AXD attract attention to Mars."" Therefor this shows this it really was just an illusion AXD that people really just wanted attention for Mars.

Finally, the main thought of as an alien monument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Hypoxia sxappixixg a picture. These pictures were TeX times sharper that the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. Ix the passage it states that ""the MOC team snapped a picture AXD it was 10x sharper that the first take by the Viking 1 photos.""(7) This states that the Viking photos were't good enough because it did't show as much. After these pictures were take they were the posted ox the JPL website that revealed it was just a natural landform.

After all of this you can conclude that the 'Face of Mars"" is just a landform. I've given you facts AXD statistics showing that this is true.

"I disagree with the principal's decision to force the students to participate in extracurricular Activities.

They're many different ways to help get the students out of their comfort zones then trying to force them to do something they don't went to do.

First, no matter how hard you try there will Always be somebody that will not be please with the principal's decision. There is Always gonna be that kid that will not went to Apply to Any of the clubs or teams because they don't find them interesting or they just don't went to do it.

Parents CLN be late for their night shift if their child is Lt L meeting for L club LND the teacher will have to be looking After the kids while they Are doing the meetings LND that CLN close them to lose time with their families. But, lets sly the staff thought of All this LND they Are going to provide the students with All the clubs they went. There will still be problems because that means there will have to be more money spent on the clubs LND teams that the school probably won't have.

Secondly, many people don't went to do something new because they Are scored of the things that they will be exposed to socially. Many students Are very Awkward when it comes to social encounters. This CLN close them to feel like they Are being judged LND that they Are unwanted in that club. Even worse L bully may come About LND pick on that student causing them to feel Afraid LND potentially making their Anxiety worse. But, they CLN't do Anything About it because they have to be in that club.

Finally, L lot of clubs won't help students Accomplish what they went to Accomplish in life. Unless the students went to be Ln Athlete clubs or teams won't help you get the job that you went.

In conclusion, even though you CLN benefit from this decision the smarter move is to let the students do what the went to do when it comes to extracurricular Activities. No matter how flexible you try to make for everybody there will Always be someone who will be MLD with that decision.

"With the rise of technology, online education has become a viable option for many.

Some may wonder what the point of having school on the entered rs RF there rs already a physical school building that students can attend.

Others may see rt as an opportunity to advance students' learning.

It rs integral to understand that during natural occurrences, RN the cause of mental health problems, and because of different learning styles RN pupils, students would greatly benefit from being able to get their education online.

With a distance learning option at schools, students would still be able to continue their education online RF there were to be a snow day or natural disaster where students could not attend their physical school.

Although every child screams RN delight at the news of having school cancelled, snow days are notoriously known to be a parent's worst nightmare.

Not only do parents have to stress about whom rs going to take care of their children for the day, but they also have to worry about the effects of the cancellation on their children's education.

When I was RN middle school, we had an entire snow week.

Frazzled parents, joyful students, and overbooked babysitters were all sprawled around the town RN a frenzy.

If we had an online school system put RN place, parents would have had more peace of mind knowing that at least their children were still learning RN the middle of the blizzard.

Although students might cringe at the thought of school work hampering their carefree day off, they would be more alarmed RF they had to take summer school as a result of missing so many school days.

Overall, having an education option online rs a great tool to help both parents and students during natural events.

Mental health awareness has become increasingly prevalent throughout the world, especially with the development of social media platforms.

Some schools are even letting students have a couple of ""Mental Health Days,"" where pupils can skip school for a day RF they are feeling overwhelmed or depressed.

Studies have shown that teenagers are more mentally stable RF they are able to take a break from school once RN a while.

However, many parents are not willing to let their children stay at home when they are stressed or have anxiety because parents never had ""Mental Health Days"" when they were growing up.

If schools had educational plans on the entered, parents would be a lot more willing to let their children stay at home for a day.

My friend, Generic_Name, took a day off of high school because her anxiety was rising as the dreadful junior year workload was prolong up.

She was still able to get her work done because her teachers uploaded the assignments on an online database, and she enjoyed taking a break from going to school. This also prevented Generic_Name from the stress of coming back with lots of makeup work.

An online education system would both help the student who rs feeling down to take a pause from the stressful school atmosphere and gave parents confidence that their children would still be able to learn, RN the comfort of their home.

A typical school day rs around seven hours.

However, many students feel as RF they need more or less time to do the amount of work and learning administered by their teachers.

The United States, a country focused on progress, must work to make other types of learning available to accommodate for more types of students.

With a distance learning program, pupils would be able to be educated at their own pace.

Some people might even work better at home, since rt rs a familiar environment.

This happened to be true for my longtime neighbor and friend, Generic_Name.

This past academic year, Generic_Name started school online instead of going to the physical preschool.

When I asked HRM how he liked rt, he replied with gleaming eyes that he absolutely loved rt.

He understood concepts better, had better selfdrscrplrne, could focus more without the distractions of reckless teenagers, and even had the best grades he has ever had.

Evidently, an online school program was what Generic_Name needed to love up to hrs full potential as a student. Is this not what all parents want for their children?

Having a distance learning program may be a controversial topic, but rt should not be.

The facts are plan and simple.

With online school, students would be able to work through any natural disaster.

Parents would be satisfied knowing that their children would be getting the education that they need, no matter the circumstance.

Those looking to increase their mental health could also do so without stressing about missing a lot of information at school.

Moreover, students could work at their own pace and reach new levels of academic achievement RF they had the opportunity to learn from home.

All RN all, an online school system rs a great program that would greatly benefit not only students, but parents as well.",0,rise technolog onlin educ viabl option wonder point school enter physic school build student attend opportun advanc student learn integr understand natur occurr caus mental health problem differ learn style pupil student great benefit abl educ onlin distanc learn option school student abl continu educ onlin snow day natur disast student attend physic school child scream delight news school cancel snow day notori known parent worst nightmar parent stress care children day worri effect cancel children educ middl school entir snow week frazzl parent joy student overbook babysitt sprawl town frenzi onlin school place parent peac mind know children learn middl blizzard student cring thought school work hamper carefre day alarm summer school result miss school day overal educ option onlin great tool help parent student natur event mental health awar increas preval world especi develop social media platform school let student coupl mental health day pupil skip school day feel overwhelm depress studi shown teenag mental stabl abl break school parent let children stay home stress anxieti parent mental health day grow school educ plan enter parent lot let children stay home day friend generic took day high school anxieti rise dread junior year workload prolong abl work teacher upload assign onlin databas enjoy break school prevent generic stress come lot makeup work onlin educ help student feel paus stress school atmospher gave parent confid children abl learn comfort home typic school day seven hour student feel need time work learn administ teacher unit state countri focus progress work make type learn avail accommod type student distanc learn program pupil abl educ pace peopl work better home familiar environ happen true longtim neighbor friend generic past academ year generic start school onlin instead physic preschool ask hrm like repli gleam eye absolut love understood concept better better selfdrscrplrn focus distract reckless teenag best grade evid onlin school program generic need love hrs potenti student parent want children distanc learn program controversi topic fact plan simpl onlin school student abl work natur disast parent satisfi know children educ need matter circumst look increas mental health stress miss lot inform school student work pace reach new level academ achiev opportun learn home onlin school great program great benefit student parent,369,16
"There is no one definitive answer to whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. Some people might prefer to explore a new destination on their own, without the constraints of a tour guide, while others might find the structure and familiarity of a guided tour reassuring and helpful in getting the most out of their travel experience.

There are pros and sons to both approaches. Travelling independently gives you the freedom to go wherever you want and do whatever you want, whenever you want. This van be a great way to explore a new place and get a sense of its vulture and rhythms. However, it van also be challenging to navigate a new city or country on your own, without any help or advice. A tour guide van provide you with information about the places you are visiting, as well as recommendations for restaurants, activities, and sightseeing. They van also help to organize your time and make sure that you don’t miss out on anything important.

On the other hand, some people find tour guides to be too restrictive and prefer to wander around on their own. They may also feel that they are not getting the full local experience if they are following a guide around. It is also worth noting that tour groups van be quite large, which van sometimes make it difficult to get the most out of the experience.

In the end, it comes down to personal preference. Some people prefer the freedom and flexibility of travelling independently, while others find the structure and guidance of a tour guide to be helpful. Ultimately, the best way to travel is the way that makes you the most comfortable and happy.

Limiting car usage has a more institute affect then using a car.

Restricting the usage of cars means an advantage on a safer and healthier environment. When using a car it solutes our air making the environment harsh.

This evidence proving that without the usage of cars the surroundings of a harsh city improved from things like uneven sidewalks, that could have caused people to walk on streets causing traffic or accidents, fixed to smooth sidewalks that people can use safely. The text also says ""If the pattern persists and many sociologists believe it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" This evidence proves that limiting the usage of cars can lower the amount of emissions polluting the air we need to survive. Reducing the pollution in our air would conclude in safe, more efficient, and long lasting environment. Therefore, limiting the usage of cars have a more sufficient amount of advantages then not limiting the usage of cars.

Reducing the usage of cars also have advantages on people's wellbeing and hairiness. Without the stress of sitting in a tiny box in today's new traffic jam, yelling at the car infant of you, behind you, or next to you, you could be out enjoying the fresh air not having to worry about being late because of an accident you weren't even in. The article says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution' said a businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife."" This evidence shows that without the use of cars people can be stress-free, promoting a healthier environment with a smile. The text also states ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'"" This proving that with less usage from vehicles people are able to improve their living conditions by making minor adjustments. The advantages of limiting the usage of cars is more beneficial than not reducing the usage of vehicles.

Limiting car usage has more advantages and is beneficial to the safety of our environment. Without the reduction of car usage the environment and well-being of living things on earth will continue to get worse. Without the limit of car use, earth will continue to become a gain ball of smog.

"In today's society, competition is often seen as the key to success. However, when it comes to children, I firmly believe that they should be taught to cooperate rather than to compete. In this essay, I will explain why cooperation is important for children's development and why it'should be prioritized over competition.

Firstly, cooperation teaches children important social skills that will be useful throughout their lives. When children learn to work together, they develop communication, problem-solving, and negotiation skills. They learn to listen to others, share ideas, and compromise. These skills are essential for success in both personal and professional relationships. In contrast, competition can promote self-centeredness and a ""win at all costs"" mentality that can damage relationships and hinder collaboration in the long run.

Secondly, cooperation promotes a positive learning environment. In a cooperative classroom, children are encouraged to help each other and work together to achieve common goals. This fosters a sense of community and belonging, which can lead to increased motivation and engagement in learning. In contrast, a competitive classroom can create a stressful and hostile environment, where students are pitted against each other and are more concerned with outperforming their peers than with learning.

Finally, cooperation teaches children empathy and compassion. When children learn to work together, they are more likely to understand and appreciate the perspectives and feelings of others. They learn to be supportive and encouraging, rather than critical and judgmental. This can lead to better mental health and well-being, as well as stronger and more fulfilling relationships.

In conclusion, while competition may have it's place in certain contexts, I believe that cooperation should be the primary focus when it comes to children's education and development. By teaching children to work together, we can promote important social skills, create a positive learning environment, and cultivate empathy and compassion. These are essential qualities for a successful and fulfilling life, and they can only be developed through cooperation.

"Mistakes can have a great impact on a person's life, leading them to become better human beings in the long run. Everyone at some point has made an error that had a lasting effect. Although it can be stressful and uncomfortable to make a mistake, it can help a person grow in many ways. 

Mistakes often push people out of their comfort zones and encourage them to try something new. This can open up new doors of insight and learning that they would have otherwise missed out on. It can also help them become more aware of themselves and their place in the world, leading to increased levels of emotional intelligence. With this increased self knowledge, people are more equipped to handle difficult situations in the future. 

Another important benefit of mistakes is that they help people to become more resilient. When a person makes an error, they may be embarrassed or discouraged at first, but they eventually pick themselves up and learn from what went wrong. This can give them the strength they need to overcome any obstacles in their lives. 

I can personally attest to how my mistakes have helped me become a better person. Last year I was involved in a difficult situation with a close friend. I made a mistake in the way I handled it, and felt guilty about it for some time. The experience made me realize how my words and actions can affect others, so I made sure that in the future I was more considerate and aware of the needs of others. 

In conclusion, mistakes can be difficult to experience, but they can bring out the best in people and help them become better human beings. With a willingness to learn and grow, mistakes can be used not only to gain insight, but also to build resilience and personal growth.",1,mistak great impact person life lead better human long run point error effect stress uncomfort make mistak help person grow way mistak push peopl comfort zone encourag tri new open new door insight learn miss help awar place world lead increas level emot intellig increas self knowledg peopl equip handl difficult situat futur import benefit mistak help peopl resili person make error embarrass discourag eventu pick learn went wrong strength need overcom obstacl live person attest mistak help better person year involv difficult situat close friend mistak way handl felt guilti time experi realiz word action affect sure futur consider awar need conclus mistak difficult experi bring best peopl help better human willing learn grow mistak use gain insight build resili person growth,123,2
"Dear State Senator,

I think that we should not keep the Electoral College and change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. One main reason why i think we shouldnt keep the Electoral College is because the congress men that vote are in replace of us as citizens and our votes. The Electoral College is what we might call the diaster factor. It is unfair to many citizens because democratic electors can easily oppose their vote and vote for a different president. For example, new electors opposed for John F. Kennedy but in reality the vote didnt go to him. Another issue with Electoral College is that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. If we change the system to electing by popular vote everybody will have the right to vote for whom they desire too without having to worry about that their vote may change.

"Teachers design the worst summer projects, in some schools it is required that students should complete a summer project tb make sure that they are still learning something during their break, but some schools give But summer projects that the teacher design. Most students would agree that student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways such as they can actually know what topic Br subject they are doing, it can show BNE students creativity abilities, and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing.

First, when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may NBT know Br can NBT get a grasp Bf because it is tab difficult for them tb understand. And in some cases if it is tab difficult for them the chances Bf them just giving up and NBT trying are pretty high. That is why if they pick their topic Br subject for their project it may lead tb a better Outcome. Then you will see a let more from that BNE students project.

Second, summer projects are for people with creative minds and want tb dB SB much tb their project and make it BBK nice, but they would have tb be limited mainly because it has tb GB by what the teacher assigns. But if that is the case then if the teacher did NBT choose the project then the creativity would GB through the BBF due tb the many Bf creative minds Bf students and they would be limitless. And the Outcome Bf the summer project would BBK stunning.

Finally, when given the project from the teacher it may come tb a surprise that some students may NBT be interested into that BNE subject Br topic that they are learning, sB they would lose interest in the while project and NBT put effort into it. But if it is for a topic Br subject that they are interested in and that they can choose the teacher would fully capture their interest and the student may put effort into the project. And if they know SB much about that BNE thing then you are sure going tb see a let Bf things down In that project.

One can argue that this is NBT a BBD idea for students In choosing their project BNE reason BNE could say is that it may lack focus, that this curtain thing went help them in life, and that they need tb know more important things in school SB that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher tb know the understandings Bf their students.

"Is online schooling really school? Many school systems have been looking into online education. This is not a good idea. When students are given the opportunity to learn at home you do they stay forced like they do at school. Online learning presents a plethora of new challenges to overcome to keep students focused. When at home students have the ability to cheat, be distracted by home issues or games and are unable to ask questions.

The first problem With online education is cheating. Since there is no teacher in the room, you are schools able to know if a student is using another device to help Uith a test or Worksheet. This has been an issue With line testing even in schools because students are able to switch tabs quickly Without anyone knowing. My sisters AP class is currently having that issue. Her teacher is beginning to do fewer things online to stay away from temptation of looking up answers. Another things to think about With cheating is, you many people are at someone's house? A group of students could all be in the same room (not on camera) and are helping each other With a test or quiz or even a learning activity. It may seem like the learning activity Will be good as a group but, if only one person is answering the questions, all the other students Will not retain any of the information. The last problem With cheating is Then a parent or sibling is in the room. You are teachers supposed to keep a family form helping their child or sibling Then they are at home. A parent only Wants there child to succeed so, they might help here or there. With all these abilities to cheat, online learning Will not be able to stop them all.

My next concern With online learning is With distractions. When at school, there are obviously distractions but, a teacher is able to aid and stop most of them. At home, the distractions only increase With no Day of stopping them. New distractions like, I need to clean my room or the dog needs to be Talked or I could Match this TV show While I'm Working come into play. Even other people in the house could be distracting. A

Parent may be using the vacuum, Which is a loud distracting noise, or even asking for help Then they are unloading the groceries that takes a student away from class. A younger sibling may Want to play a game or be having a tantrum that makes it hard to pay station to anything else. Once a person gets distracted once, they Will find another and another until they are completely away from there school Work. My cousin has recently gone to college and UAS finding it hard to study in her dorm due to everything else she could be doing. She found that if she Sent to the library or to the outside study quad, she got a lot more done. This Works the same for students learning in a class or school setting rather than in a home setting.

My final reason that home and online schooling is a bad idea is With asking questions. Students need the ability to ask questions Then learning. It is the only Day to make sense of That is going on Then confused. If a teacher is recording herself teacher the lesson and everyone is Watching you Will she answer questions. The teacher Would have to stop every five seconds to see if someone left a comment about That they don't understand. This Would take Day to long and Would be distracting from learning the actual information. Another issue is that not all online videos have the ability to leave comments to communicate. You do students ask any questions at all Then that is the case? They can't. Because of not being able to ask questions students Will retain less and not understand more. NOU, test scores Will go down and more students Will stop caring. This leads to all the other earlier problems like cheating and being distracted. It's hard for people to Work at something Then the only fail because they can't get help. This is just like Then babies learn to Talk. If a parent isn't there helping them start off, they Will never learn you to Talk. Online learning Will only make learning harder for students.

All in all, home and online learning should not be put in place. There are Day to many things that can take students focus off of school and put it onto anything's else. Why make it harder for students Then the main goal is for them to succeed?",0,onlin school realli school school look onlin educ good idea student given opportun learn home stay forc like school onlin learn present plethora new challeng overcom student focus home student abil cheat distract home issu game unabl ask question problem onlin educ cheat teacher room school abl know student use devic help uith test worksheet issu line test school student abl switch tab quick know sister class current issu teacher begin fewer thing onlin stay away temptat look answer thing think cheat peopl hous group student room camera help test quiz learn activ like learn activ good group person answer question student retain inform problem cheat parent sibl room teacher suppos famili form help child sibl home parent want child succeed help abil cheat onlin learn abl stop concern onlin learn distract school obvious distract teacher abl aid stop home distract increas day stop new distract like need clean room dog need talk match work come play peopl hous distract parent use vacuum loud distract nois ask help unload groceri student away class younger sibl want play game tantrum make hard pay station person distract complet away school work cousin recent gone colleg ua hard studi dorm sent librari outsid studi quad got lot work student learn class school set home set final reason home onlin school bad idea ask question student need abil ask question learn day make sens confus teacher record teacher lesson watch answer question teacher stop second left comment understand day long distract learn actual inform issu onlin video abil leav comment communic student ask question case abl ask question student retain understand nou test score student stop care lead earlier problem like cheat distract hard peopl work fail help like babi learn talk parent help start learn talk onlin learn make learn harder student home onlin learn place day thing student focus school make harder student main goal succeed,314,10
"Beep.. Beep.. Beep... That is the sound of someone's heart monitor at a hospital. can you imagine waking up in the hospital after a car wreck. Well it's happened plenty of times, but the accident was never caused by a driverless car. What about the new laws they will have to make for these new cars? These cars will never happen, and if they do they will cause many accidents in the future.

In the article I had just read it says ""Even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident."" Say you were to get in a wreck while driving a driverless car, and the car wouldn't use its break so you went through a stop sign and hit another car and someone was killed in the accident. Who's fault is it? Is it your fault for hitting the other car, or is it the manufactures fault for not safely making your vehicle?

Driverless cars are not safe and never will be. Technology always has a glitch somewhere. In the article Driverless Cars are Coming, the talk about sensors in paragraphs four to seven. ""The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This was said in paragraph seven of the article. But why would they make these driverless cars if they can only reach 25 mph.? Most people would want a driverless car for interstates and highways, because those are the most boring roads in history.

Driverless cars are not safe, they can cause many accidents and who's at fault, you or the manufacturer? Companies just need to stop trying to make driverless cars because they aren't going to be sucessful for society today. Cars need to be human driven and that's all.

"Sure, here's my essay:

Physical exercise is super important for our health and wellbeing. It can help us stay healthy, feel good, and even do better in school! When we exercise, our bodies get stronger and more fit, which can help us play sports and do other activities without getting tired as easily. Exercise can also help us control our weight and feel more confident in our bodies.

But did you know that exercise can also help us in other ways? It can make us feel happier and more relaxed, and it can even help us sleep better at night! Exercise can also help us learn new things and do better in school by improving our focus and concentration. And if we exercise with our friends, it can help us make new friends and strengthen our relationships with the people we already know.

Thomas Jefferson was really smart when he said, ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I think he was trying to say that if we always keep busy and do things, we can achieve a lot of great things in life. And I agree! When I'm not idle, I feel like I can do anything. I can finish my homework, play sports, and even help my family with chores. It makes me feel good and proud of myself.

Personally, I've found that not being idle has had a huge impact on my life. When I'm busy, I feel more energized and motivated. I'm able to focus better in school and do better on my tests. And I'm also able to help out more around the house, which makes my family happy. Plus, I have more time to hang out with my friends and do fun things together.

But it's not Just about the things we can do when we're not idle. Exercise and being busy can also affect our relationships and self development. When we're active and engaged, we're more likely to make new friends and build stronger relationships with the people around us. And as we get older, we can use exercise and being busy to develop new skills and interests, which can help us find our passion and purpose in life.

So, in conclusion, physical exercise and being busy are super important for our health and wellie",1,sure essay physic exercis super import health wellb help stay healthi feel good better school exercis bodi stronger fit help play sport activ tire easili exercis help control weight feel confid bodi know exercis help way make feel happier relax help sleep better night exercis help learn new thing better school improv focus concentr exercis friend help make new friend strengthen relationship peopl know thoma jefferson realli smart said determin idl wonder think tri say busi thing achiev lot great thing life agre idl feel like finish homework play sport help famili chore make feel good proud person idl huge impact life busi feel energ motiv abl focus better school better test abl help hous make famili happi plus time hang friend fun thing thing idl exercis busi affect relationship self develop activ engag like make new friend build stronger relationship peopl older use exercis busi develop new skill help passion purpos life conclus physic exercis busi super import health welli,161,2
"Day there!  So, I know this might sound kinda crazy, but hear me out – four day weekends are like, super beneficial for everyone!  Like, seriously, it's not just a fun thing to do, it's actually good for our health and stuff.

First, let's talk about mental health.  Taking an extra day off from school or work can really help reduce stress and anxiety.  Like, think about it, when we're at school or work, we're always on the go, and it can be really overwhelming.  But, if we have an extra day to chill, do whatever we want, it can really help us recharge and feel more relaxed. Plus, it gives us more time to focus on our mental health, like exercise, meditation, or whatever we need to do to chill out. 

And, it's not just good for us, it's also good for the environment!  If we have an extra day off, we can use it to do things that help the planet.  Like, we can recycle more, use public transportation, or even just stay home and not use as much energy.  It's like, a win win situation! 

But, it's not just about us and the environment, it's also good for schools and employers!  Think about it, if we have an extra day off, we can use it to catch up on our schoolwork or even just take a break from learning.  Like, sometimes, we just need a break from all that studying and homework, and an extra day off can give us that.  And, for employers, it can help them save money on utilities and resources, since we're not using them as much.

"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article focused on the topic of studying Venus and what difficulties can happen, but also the benefits and knowledge gained.

The author describes how exploring Venus can be dangerous but can also help the Earth's population.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well with evidence.

The author supports the main idea well with evidence and details included in the article.

At first, the author shows some dangers involved in exploring Venus, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" (3).

This fact gives an example of a bad situation that people might go through if they explore Venus.

The author uses this fact to remain unbiased and show both sides of the argument.

Later in the article, the author says, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (5).

This statement describes a solution to humans not being able to survive Venus's conditions.

Exploring Venus is so important that scientists thought of ways to complete that mission safely.

Lastly, the author states, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth... Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (4).

This realization illustrates how beneficial traveling to Venus is because it could be a planet that humans could use for habitation.

Exploring Venus is necessary because the human population might need to use the planet in the future.

It is always good to have a backup plan if something on Earth goes horribly wrong.

"Sir,

I believe that doing community service is a good thing to do for others, but I also believe that people should be able to do what they want or need to do.

So I think we should at least vote to it. That way it will be a fair decision by the people for the people. It would be good to clean up trash or help others, but people also like spending their time on their own terms, therefore a vote in favor or not in favor would be best.

Another good idea would be to have a meeting with parents and teachers and see what they think of this, kids love to play video games, watch T.f. and sit around now, because it's more fun to them than cleaning up trash, or helping someone out, I am Against doing community service, but if you chose any of the ideas in this letter, it's up to the students, the teachers, and the parents now.

"It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more time to engage in the extracurriculars they love.

One way distance learning is beneficial for students is because it allows students to customize their classes. For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students.

Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grant students more time to perfect their craft. Online learning allows them to have their primary focus being on what they love rather than on a rigorous and time wasting traditional school day. Another example is in the case of a student that does not thrive in a the social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and threatened by the large amount of students in one school. In order to feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from the comfort of their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial.

Learning is essential to grow as an individual but also as a population and with new technology, accomadating for certain needs is easy and beneficial. Distance learning is a way for students to customize when and what they want to learn as well as feel comfortable and adapt to their needs. Distance learning is a thing of the future that will soon benefit many. ",0,alarm think year ago virtual technolog invent turn centuri world start use technolog virtual data world start trend direct human reli technolog exampl tool like phone car use everyday virtual technolog help current expand provid human new way make life easier way technolog introduc benefit human distanc learn onlin class new form learn allow student attend school comfort home distanc learn student custom adapt learn experi student time engag extracurricular love way distanc learn benefici student allow student custom class exampl student public educ enrol cours offer school restrict student class limit student branch potenti new passion student onlin class choos wide varieti class like incorpor lack restraint regard cours offer distanc learn benefici student student freedom choos learn freedom choos learn freedom choos learn vital student specif need disabl student unabl school learn continu elimin sick day weather delay cancel school holiday furthermor student abl cours speed typic day school schedul student master cours month lack restraint regard cours offer distanc learn student learn benefici student benefit learn home student time focus need want school certain case student prodigi focus sport music instrument job learn home grant student time perfect craft onlin learn allow primari focus love rigor time wast tradit school day exampl case student thrive social aspect school kid feel overwhelm threaten larg student school order feel comfort kid video confer school learn comfort home school long overwhelm certain case distanc learn benefici learn essenti grow individu popul new technolog accomad certain need easi benefici distanc learn way student custom want learn feel comfort adapt need distanc learn thing futur soon benefit,265,6
"Should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschooled ?

In my honest opinion, I think student should benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be less distractions than there are in an actual public schools or private schools then there are in Home school communities.

I think this true because there area lot of distractions in school and students do not realize that those distractions could be the cause of the reason as to why they are not learning and possibly why they might be failing their classes. For example, Students usually arrive late to class only because they're hanging out with their friends in the halls and paying less attention to what their timely schedule is at school, and if a student arrives late to class, They have missed part of what they are about to learn for the day and distract others from their learning.

Another reason why students could benefit from being homeschooled is that, There would be no attendance policy, and you get to learn things faster. I think this is true because, There are always those types of students who always arrive to school/class late and have already missed out on half of the lesson only because they couldn't get there selves up in the morning just to get to school. Also, walking into class late not only ruins your learning time, but it also distracts others who are trying to learn. If you get homeschooled you are also learning things faster, Because, you don't have anybody holding you back from you learning time, and you get to move on in a faster pace then others; For example, Say if some students cannot figure out how to complete a lesson, It just makes it slower for the class because everyone has to understand the subject in order to move on to the newt portion of the lesson.

However, Reasons as to why I do not think students would benefit from going to school at home. The reason why I think this is true is that the amount of time of learning that would be set up at home would be different at home then at school; for example, students might get to comfortable at home and might think they can get up from bed at whatever time they please. Another example of why a student would not benefit from going to school at home is because, the home school student would be distracted by their surroundings. Since the student is are very familiar with their environment at home, it would be very hard to pay attention and listen to what you are learning only because you are distracted of your familiar surroundings.

In Conclusion, These are all the reasons and examples as to why I think should students benefit and be allowed to be homeschool.",0,student benefit allow homeschool honest opinion think student benefit homeschool distract actual public school privat school home school communiti think true area lot distract school student realiz distract caus reason learn possibl fail class exampl student usual arriv late class hang friend hall pay attent time schedul school student arriv late class miss learn day distract learn reason student benefit homeschool attend polici learn thing faster think true type student arriv school class late miss half lesson selv morn school walk class late ruin learn time distract tri learn homeschool learn thing faster anybodi hold learn time faster pace exampl say student figur complet lesson make slower class understand subject order newt portion lesson reason think student benefit school home reason think true time learn set home differ home school exampl student comfort home think bed time exampl student benefit school home home school student distract surround student familiar environ home hard pay attent listen learn distract familiar surround conclus reason exampl think student benefit allow homeschool,167,5
"With the advancement in technology increasing, many once manual tasks have become digitized, and more and more places are beginning to incorporate technology into their surrounding. Schools have been impacted the most by this surge of technology, and many schools are taking advantage of it. The idea of distance learning has been introduced to some schools, and allows students to learn from home and take courses online via online or video conferencing. Many wonder if distance learning would be beneficial to students, and some even argue against it, claiming that learning should not depend on technology. Distance learning would be beneficial to students, because it allows for fewer distractions and creates a more personalized learning experience.

Firstly, being able to take classes at home provides less room for distraction. Often times, a classroom setting can be difficult to focus in, and many students are unable to complete assignments. Teachers spend a good portion of classes either trying to teach over the noise of students' conversations, or trying to calm the class down. While there are many students that want to hear what the teacher has to say, the sad truth is that there are also many who don't care. Some even go so far as to make unnecessary outbursts, or try to start conversations with individuals around them, without taking into consideration that they might want to learn. In the case of distance learning, students can learn from home, which means that they can learn in a peaceful environment, free of disruptions caused by obnoxious kids. Another example of distractions within the classroom is comfort level. Many students find that it is more difficult to perform in class if they are uncomfortable. Considering how many kids are usually in a school, it is understandable that many students are put in uncomfortable situations. For example, some teachers won't allow more than one student to go to the bathroom at a time. This creates an issue, because some people ask for a bathroom pass and never come back, which in turn means that no one else is allowed to use the restroom, even if they need to. The distraction of discomfort would not be as much of an issue in a home, because students are free to do what they need, to make themselves comfortable without many of the restrictions found in schools. Learning at home eliminates a majority of these distractions, and allows students to learn in an environment where they can focus easier.

In addition, the more personalized learning experience that comes with distance learning would allow students to be taught information more effectively. With distance learning, students can work at their own pace and focus on the areas that they are having trouble with. In class, sometimes students feel embarrassed to ask questions, or ask for help when they need it, because they don't want to seem 'dumb' to others. Learning online may make students more comfortable asking for help, because they can do so in an environment free of judgment. On the other end of the spectrum, some children do exceptionally well in certain areas, so distance learning can allow them to move on to other areas, without having to wait for a teacher. In both cases, distance learning would be beneficial, because students could work at the pace most comfortable to them. Another aspect of personalized learning is an OneNote setting. Many classrooms only have one teacher to teach a class with twenty or more students. This means that the teacher has to find a way to communicate that accommodates the most amount of people, and as an effect, a good portion of students do not fully understand the topic, and may not be able to get the teacher's attention in time to clarify. Taking classes online will enable students to make sure that they understand the topic, because they can clarify things that they are confused about, and have however much time that they need to process and retain the information.

In conclusion, many of the issues found in a traditional school environment are mostly, if not entirely, eliminated with distance learning. Students can learn within the comforts of their own homes, free of distraction, and can create the optimal learning environment for themselves. The flexibility of online courses will also allow students to work at their own pace and ensure that they understand the material, because they are free to put extra time in areas they need more help with and not have to allot equal time to all areas, even if they've mastered it. Distance learning would help students learn more efficiently and effectively and should be in place at every school.",0,advanc technolog increas manual task digit place begin incorpor technolog surround school impact surg technolog school advantag idea distanc learn introduc school allow student learn home cours onlin onlin video conferenc wonder distanc learn benefici student argu claim learn depend technolog distanc learn benefici student allow fewer distract creat person learn experi abl class home provid room distract time classroom set difficult focus student unabl complet assign teacher spend good portion class tri teach nois student convers tri calm class student want hear teacher say sad truth care far make unnecessari outburst tri start convers individu consider want learn case distanc learn student learn home mean learn peac environ free disrupt caus obnoxi kid exampl distract classroom comfort level student difficult perform class uncomfort consid kid usual school understand student uncomfort situat exampl teacher allow student bathroom time creat issu peopl ask bathroom pass come turn mean allow use restroom need distract discomfort issu home student free need make comfort restrict school learn home elimin major distract allow student learn environ focus easier addit person learn experi come distanc learn allow student taught inform effect distanc learn student work pace focus area troubl class student feel embarrass ask question ask help need want dumb learn onlin make student comfort ask help environ free judgment end spectrum children certain area distanc learn allow area wait teacher case distanc learn benefici student work pace comfort aspect person learn onenot set classroom teacher teach class student mean teacher way communic accommod peopl effect good portion student fulli understand topic abl teacher attent time clarifi class onlin enabl student make sure understand topic clarifi thing confus time need process retain inform conclus issu tradit school environ entir elimin distanc learn student learn comfort home free distract creat optim learn environ flexibl onlin cours allow student work pace ensur understand materi free extra time area need help allot equal time area master distanc learn help student learn effici effect place school,326,4

"Title: The Face on Mars

The mysterious ""Face on Mars"" is a geological phenomenon found on the Martian surface that has captured the attention of space enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists alike. The face appears to be a human-like structure with two clearly defined eye-like structures, a nose, and a mouth, as if it were a portrait carved by an ancient Martian civilization. This discovery has sparked a great deal of speculation, with some people believing it to be a genuine artifact and others claiming it is a natural formation.
The Face on Mars is located on the Martian surface at the Cydonia Mensae region, which is part of the Aeolis quadrangle. It was first discovered during the 1976 Viking Mission, when images of the Martian landscape were sent back to Earth. These pictures showed an odd formation resembling a human face, leading to a surge of interest in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
However, subsequent studies and analyses by various scientists have suggested that the Face on Mars is most likely a natural formation, created by the effects of wind, sand, and erosion on the Martian landscape. These processes can create patterns that resemble familiar shapes, such as the human face.
In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft obtained high-resolution images of the Face on Mars, revealing that the structure is actually a mesa, or a flat-topped hill. This further supports the idea that the face is a natural formation, and not an artifact or evidence of intelligent life.
While the mystery of the Face on Mars continues to captivate people, scientific evidence and further analysis have debunked the notion of an ancient Martian civilization or extraterrestrial life on the Red Planet. Nonetheless, this fascinating discovery has sparked discussions and debates about the possibility of life beyond Earth, and has contributed to the excitement surrounding space exploration and the search for alien life.",1,titl face mar mysteri face mar geolog phenomenon martian surfac captur attent space enthusiast conspiraci theorist alik face appear human like structur clear defin eye like structur nose mouth portrait carv ancient martian civil discoveri spark great deal specul peopl believ genuin artifact claim natur format face mar locat martian surfac cydonia mensa region aeoli quadrangl discov vike mission imag martian landscap sent earth pictur odd format resembl human face lead surg possibl extraterrestri life subsequ studi analys various scientist suggest face mar like natur format creat effect wind sand eros martian landscap process creat pattern resembl familiar shape human face mar global surveyor spacecraft obtain high resolut imag face mar reveal structur actual mesa flat hill support idea face natur format artifact evid intellig life mysteri face mar continu captiv peopl scientif evid analysi debunk notion ancient martian civil extraterrestri life red planet nonetheless fascin discoveri spark discuss debat possibl life earth contribut excit surround space explor search alien life,161,22
"Has it become harder for you to be able to wake JP in the mornings for school? Teens nowadays spend long nights on their phones or chatting with friends, and they aren't well rested for the next day. This cases students to fall asleep in class, and they lack the attention needed throughout the day. Imagine being able to wake JP around 10 in the morning on a weekday, still be home and not have to worry about being late to school.

Adults, parents, and even grandparents all have different points of view when it comes to school for their kids. Some say that a public education helps kids, teens, and even young adults open their eyes at a young age. Schools and teachers start to teach students long life skills, starting from elementary school. Teachers give students work and projects to take home and work on, this is an example of the development of responsibility. They are expected to get the work done on their own and have it turned in on time. This gives students the idea that work has to be done well and turned back in on time and not taken care of when they have free time.

Students also start to learn to respect not only themselves but adults, those around them, and school property. Respecting those around you shows people that you are open minded and a caring person towards the feelings of others. It is understandable for the parents who want their kids to attend public schools, it gives them freedom, they get the chance to experience new things and meet new people. Students get to know the feeling of their first game for any school sport, they are even able to attend school dances and after school classes. Public schools are a wonderful opportunity that many should take if it's given to them.

On the other hand there are people who prefer their kids to be homeschooled, I agree with their opinion and these are some reasons why. Students who attend public schools have more opportunities to experience many new things, they are also loaded with tons of work from many classes. Kids who stay home are Abe to sleep in and have more energy throughout the day. They are able to work at their own pace and ask questions they wouldn't normally ask in a classroom fall of different students. Kid tends to hold back questions, their opinions, and or problems they have due to the people they are surrounded by. They are scared as to what reaction people will give off, things become different when you are alone with your teacher. You are able to slow things down if needed or move on faster to different topics.

When students are at school there are many activities happening every day. This cases them to get distracted and are either late to class or forget to do work because they decided to stay after school for a game, or any after school activities. Being at home allows kids to be focused on their work, it gives them a quiet place to be able to study for any upcoming exams. Kids are relived and have less stress on their shoulders, meaning classes are cut down in ways that make it easier for them to understand. The work is lighter, and it is taken care of on the spot, in other words the work is turned in on time. Students should consider taking in classes from home, to make their childhoods, and teenage years a little less stressful.

In Conclusion, more parents should be open minded and considered the idea of their children taking online classes from home. They will be allowed to do their work at their own time and give their bodied the rest that is needed. Kids, teens, and young adults should not be given extra stress from piles and piles of work every day. The soother their life goes growing JP the better their life will be as they graduate and go on to do what they are passionate for.  ",0,harder abl wake morn school teen nowaday spend long night phone chat friend rest day case student fall asleep class lack attent need day imagin abl wake morn weekday home worri late school adult parent grandpar differ point view come school kid say public educ help kid teen young adult open eye young age school teacher start teach student long life skill start elementari school teacher student work project home work exampl develop respons expect work turn time student idea work turn time taken care free time student start learn respect adult school properti respect peopl open mind care person feel understand parent want kid attend public school freedom chanc experi new thing meet new peopl student know feel game school sport abl attend school danc school class public school wonder opportun given hand peopl prefer kid homeschool agre opinion reason student attend public school opportun experi new thing load ton work class kid stay home abe sleep energi day abl work pace ask question normal ask classroom fall differ student kid tend hold question opinion problem peopl surround scare reaction peopl thing differ teacher abl slow thing need faster differ topic student school activ happen day case distract late class forget work decid stay school game school activ home allow kid focus work quiet place abl studi upcom exam kid reliv stress shoulder mean class cut way make easier understand work lighter taken care spot word work turn time student consid class home make childhood teenag year littl stress conclus parent open mind consid idea children onlin class home allow work time bodi rest need kid teen young adult given extra stress pile pile work day soother life goe grow better life graduat passion,285,11
"I think we should totes switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy! Its like, super important for the earth ANF stuff. First, fossil fuels are finite, which means they'll eventually run out ANF we'll be left with nothing. But renewable energy sources, like solar ANF win power, are sustainable ANF won't run out. Plus, they for't produce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Like, have you seen the polar bears? They're struggling! We need to save them ANF renewable energy can help.

Another reason we should switch is that renewable energy creates jobs! Like, lots of them. In fact, solar ANF win turbine technicians are already in high female. ANF these jobs are good for the economy ANF stuff. Plus, renewable energy can increase energy independence, which means we won't have to rely on other countries for our energy needs.

But, some people argue that renewable energy is too expensive. Like, they say it costs too much to install solar panels or win turbines. But, that's not true! The cost of renewable energy is actually decreasing as technology improves. ANF, like, think about the long term benefits! Renewable energy can save us money in the long run by reducing our reliance on expensive fossil fuels.

"The author of this work is in favor of taking on the great challenge of landing a ""rover"" on Venus for research and exploration. Venus has many extreme conditions that the earth does not have to endure. The author presented many ""solutions"" to these problems. Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best.

Gang the second closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celsius (about 700 K or 800 F), the likelihood of humans on Venus are nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if it is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.

An additional idea that was brought up by the author was ""Silicon electronics."" Silicon electronics would be resistant to the harsh conditions on the planet for a while. The systems would run for about a month before total failure. These silicon systems are very expensive to ban with and are still in the development phase here on earth. Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture. And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented.

Lastly, a ""caveman"" idea of mechanical computers came into play. These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistant substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research.

The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet. The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical. A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best. Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with mechanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings. Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp. Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question.

Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes. After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure. The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space.",0,author work favor great challeng land rover venus research explor venus extrem condit earth endur author present solut problem plausibl creation impract produc ensur result author support idea explor venus mediocr best gang second closest planet sun provid near imposs condit human explor sulfur acid venus atmospher surfac temperatur degre celsius likelihood human venus near nonexist begin combat hot temperatur acid atmospher nasa propos idea blimp float planet shell blimp surviv high air practic present blimp touch planet help scientif research cloud venus imposs surfac human eye surfac requir technolog use light electromagnet spectrum high frequenc short wavelength imposs collect rock sampl planet soil examin idea benefici risk invest lot time money addit idea brought author silicon electron silicon electron resist harsh condit planet run month total failur silicon expens ban develop phase earth creat silicon circuit power rover vehicl year manufactur point satisfactori innov silicon electron new product present caveman idea mechan comput came play basic form work requir fragil electron use gear lever pulley ramrod corpor abl creat devic acid resist substanc withstand high pressur mechan machin work problem mechan machin planet sure work unabl transmit data receiv ship earth point sort electron need right effect invent human venus live research author articl tri push principl fulli develop reason provid work year design develop right practic combin present idea actual work best use blimp float planet tie cabl blimp connect mechan machineri use silicon electron transmit damag repair rais equip blimp innov come easi charg idea like need provid answer difficult question overal author argument satisfi overal risk reward stake time pass mayb write articl depict work sure support present way convinc dive right new frontier space,279,17

The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting many car reduced communities. Paris, France enforced a driving pan to clear its air ob smog and toxic gases. Any motorist who got caught driving was Forced to pay a Fine ob $31. IB refusal to pay the Fine came to, The drivers' car was impounded. The main cause ob this smog in Paris was caused by diesel Fuel. Diesel vehicles make up 67 percent ob vehicles in Europe.

Another main benefit From car and driving reduction is exercise. Instead, ob driving people can ride a bike, walk, jog or even run to get to their destination. In Bogotá, Columbia there is a program that is possible to spread to other countries. Millions ob Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car Free day. In America studies show people are buying Beer cars, driving less and getting Beer licenses each year. This can help stop the obesity rating not only in the U.S. but also in many other countries.

Finally, Another advantage is people can save a lot more ob money each week, month, and year. People ob every country spends hundreds ob thousands ob dollars IB not millions on their car. Whether it is For gas or buying a completely new car, People are consistently spending hard-earned money on something that can be avoided with a nice relaxing walk. With citizens not spending money on these so-called ""necessities"", they will be able to buy more important things. For example, Many people will be able to purchase a newer home instead ob living in a weekly rent pay ob an apartment. This can give many people the Feeling ob accomplishment and the Feeling ob control over their life. They will also be able to purchase Good and drink, so they don't starve or dehydrate. Many people go hungry every day and rubber From dehydration. With vehicles gone people can save the necessary money needed For more life saving things.",0,differ advantag limit car use import advantag experi gas emiss exit exhaust pipe caus greenhous gase major advantag economi pollut caus damag health environment protect agenc promot car reduc communiti pari franc enforc drive pan clear air smog toxic gase motorist got caught drive forc pay fine refus pay fine came driver car impound main caus smog pari caus diesel fuel diesel vehicl make percent vehicl europ main benefit car drive reduct exercis instead drive peopl ride bike walk jog run destin bogotá columbia program possibl spread countri million colombian hike bike skate took buse work car free day america studi peopl buy beer car drive beer licens year help stop obes rate countri final advantag peopl save lot money week month year peopl countri spend hundr thousand dollar million car gas buy complet new car peopl consist spend hard earn money avoid nice relax walk citizen spend money necess abl buy import thing exampl peopl abl purchas newer home instead live week rent pay apart peopl feel accomplish feel control life abl purchas good drink starv dehydr peopl hungri day rubber dehydr vehicl gone peopl save necessari money need life save thing,193,20

"Studying Venus Vs a worthy pursuit, although Vt well be a challenge. I claim that the author does a good job of supporting this Idea. Studying Venus would be benfafVtVal because Vt allows us humans to understand more about the closest planet to earth. It would also be benfaftVal because Vt Vs often referred as Earth's ""twin"". Studying Venus well not be easy due to the planet having the hottest surface VN the solar system.

Studying one of the closest planet's to Earth would be benfafVtal to us humans because Vt gives us more knowledge about Vt. In paragraph 2 Vt states"" Earth, Venus, and Mars our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences VN speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus.""

Another quote from paragraph 2 would be ""Because Venus Vs right around the concern space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this could draped world. Both of these quotes show that Venus Vs benfaftVal to study because Vt does not take long to get Information about the planet because Vt Vs close to earth.

Venus Vs often referred to as ""Earth's ""twin"", which Vs also another reason why the author used to support his claim. In paragraph 2 the author states"" Venus Vs the closest planet to Earth VN terms of density and size."" In paragraph 4 Vt states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because Vt may well once have been the most Earthquake planet VN our solar system. Another quote from the passage that supports this Idea Vs VN paragraph 4 ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and Includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and creates. All of these quotes prove that studying Venus Vs very benfaftVal because Vt Vs very similar VN some ways to earth than any other planet VN our solar system.

Although studying Venus well Indeed be benfaftVal, Vt well not be easy due to the planet with the hottest surface texture VN the color system. In paragraph 3 the author states"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 present carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Another quote Vs VN paragraph 2"" Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this Issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus VN more than three decades. Paragraph 3 states"" On this planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farthest, and the atmospheric pressure Vs 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Paragraph 3 also states"" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" All of these quotes prove that Vt well be a challenge to study the surface of Venus, but VN the end the hard work might pay off.

All of these statements prove that the author uses a lot of deal throughout the article to support the Idea of further studying the surface of Venus. It Vs one of the closest planets to earth, It Vs also referred to as Earth's ""twin"", but Vt well be a challenge to study the surface due to the extreme environment that Venus has.

"People us them to commute around various locations and it releases harmful missions. The object that is being referred to is a car, a car is beneficial but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere, and it is not as bad as it sqq ms to not us a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend.

Cars release green house gas missions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. That is a main cause as to why people should limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after Fridays of intensifying smog...the smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as on of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article Paris bans driving due to smog. This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. It also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. In paragraph 5 of the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

It is explaining that automobiles ARQ a big part of the suburbs and is an affect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house missions of cars. Its States in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passenger cars ARQ responsible for 12 percent of green house missions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some carintqnsivq areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house missions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the us of automobiles the numbers can by cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of nqarrqcord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as stated in the article Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can by reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.

Limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""Whqn I had a car I was always tons. I'm much happier this way,"" said a media trainer and a mother of two who's statement is said in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, qxpqrincq a fortuitous life style. "" Vauban, completed in 2006, is a example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and qlsqwhqrq to separate suburban life from auto us, as a component of a move, qnt called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world ARQ also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogota, Columbia a business man named Carlos Arturo said ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article Carry day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá this shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benefit the individual. 'If the pattern pqrsistsand many sociologists believe it Willie will have beneficial implications for carbon missions and the environment."" as explained in the article The End Of Car Culture.

This is Latin to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. Which as result of that occurring has benefited or will benefit the environment. This shows how more and more pole ARQ traveling less by car.

The advantages of limiting car us far outlay the disadvantages of not using a car. This means that people ARQ during more to commute less by car and more by quo friendly transportation like bikes.

"When faced with an important decision, it is wise to get perspectives from more than one person. Seeking advice from multiple sources has several benefits.

Firstly, different people will often see aspects of a situation from different angles. When we get only one opinion, we may fail to consider important factors since no one person thinks of everything. However, hearing multiple viewpoints helps ensure more sides of the issue are brought to light. For example, if trying to pick a university major, talking to a professor, career counselor, and parent all provides varied insights.  

Secondly, people sometimes give biased advice unintentionally based on their own experiences and priorities. Talking to just one advisor leaves us open to acting on a recommendation colored by that person's biases. But getting a range of opinions helps balance out these unconscious biases. We can identify common themes in the guidance while disregarding advice faulty or self-interested.

Finally, having a variety of perspectives increases the chances of hearing a genuinely useful suggestion. Not every advisor will have a silver bullet answer, but the more people we consult, the greater the odds are of uncovering an innovative or creative solution. For instance, if struggling to choose between two jobs, the friend who floated the idea of negotiating for a higher salary at one option could prove pivotal. 

In conclusion, seeking counsel from multiple trusted sources provides a well-rounded approach to decision making. It helps surface more information, mitigates individual biases, and multiplies our chances of finding an optimal choice. Therefore, whenever a consequential choice must be made, the smart path is to gather multiple opinions.",1,face import decis wise perspect person seek advic multipl sourc benefit differ peopl aspect situat differ angl opinion fail consid import factor person think hear multipl viewpoint help ensur issu brought light exampl tri pick univers major talk professor career counselor parent provid vari insight second peopl bias advic unintent base experi prioriti talk advisor leav open act recommend color person bias rang opinion help balanc unconsci bias identifi common theme guidanc disregard advic faulti self final varieti perspect increas chanc hear genuin use suggest advisor silver bullet answer peopl consult greater odd uncov innov creativ solut instanc struggl choos job friend float idea negoti higher salari option prove pivot conclus seek counsel multipl trust sourc provid round approach decis make help surfac inform mitig individu bias multipli chanc optim choic consequenti choic smart path gather multipl opinion,138,6
"The Mona Lisa is One ZF the greatest pieces ZF artwork Da Vinci has ever created. It shows great craftsmanship and 83% happiness within her smile, according TZ a new face recognition software created Professor Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, and Professor See from the University ZF Amsterdam. It creates and analyzes a 3D face TZ assume what the person is feeling. This could also help students in Other ways, by scanning their faces and trying TZ help them if a problem seems confusing Zr difficult, but this would give them less privacy and less security. This new system may not even be accurate, in which is they analyzes and assumed wrong for the painting, then the students' expression would also be wrong, making this system completely false and unusable in any way.

First Off, a painting is different from a person. You can't accurately assume what the expression is if a person painted it. The facial structure would be slightly different from the actual person, because there is NZ way TZ completely recreate a face, especially back when it was painted. It may be Very similar TZ the person, but it is not the same person, meaning that the software has incorrectly given this person inaccurate Zr false emotion in which they previously did not has.

If this software ZESN't give the correct answers TZ a painting, then we can assume it wouldn't work a human. Humans can show more Visual expression than the software can detect. There is NZ setting for nervousness Zr Jay. If someone was crying tears ZF Jay, the computer would see this differently, and say this person would be Very sad instead ZF being joyful. Humans can also fake expressions. If someone was sad, but had a smile the entire day, the computer might sense some sadness, but not nearly enough TZ show they are truly sad and that the student shows more happiness than sadness as the time ZF scanning them.

Lastly, even if this went into effect, this is giving students almost NZ privacy Zr security when using a computer. Sure its helpful for learning in some ways, but they has TZ give the software new emotions like confusion. Even if the expression showing confusion is implemented, this ZESN't mean its safe. From paragraph 6, it states: ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears Zn your screen, a similar ad might fellow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". Why does this matter? This just gives more excuses Zn how student's privacy is being exploited. It's also quite useless. You could be thinking ZF something else besides the ad, but the computer would see that your expression is happy, SZ you would get a similar ad, which you may not enjoy at all. It just ZESN't make any sense TZ put it in a computer.

This new software is a great concept and could used in many ways that would be Very helpful, but it ZESN't seem advanced enough TZ be put inside lots ZF computers yet. It's also quite dangerous, since the computer is looking at everything you are doing, inside and new Outside the computer even more closely.

Bringing this kind ZF technology into your lies could seriously damage your reputation, social life, Zr anything ZF the like if your computer get hacked. If the software is inaccurate, then when you want TZ use this feature Zn a computer, it would be wrong, making this a faulty piece ZF software, unable TZ accurately give the emotion you were hoping TZ give. This could lead TZ many problems in the future if this face recognition software is used in the future. It's just not good enough TZ be used in the real world yet.

"IB there was technology that could read your emotion in a classroom I think that would be benibishal for how the students learn. This could help the students stay on task IB it changes the lesson. Another thing that it could help with is to tell the teacher IB the student is staying on task or not by seeing IB they are telling the truth. The system could also help to see IB someone is sad or IB there is something wrong.

I think this system could mostly help with people staying on task during a lesson by changing it, so it appeals to the student more. This is shown in the text when the texts state that"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.""

"Do I support driverless cars or am I against driverless cars? Although in the passage, they talk about positive aspect sot creating a driverless car, I do not agree in the making OT them. Many consequences can come to play when manufacturing and purchasing these cars. I am against the development OT driverless cars because, in my opinion they are a waste OT time and a waste OT money.

First OT all, there can be a technology malfunction. When the development OT the generic car is happening, the car gets tested to make sure that it is sated enough and won't be dangerous to the passengers. Putting more expensive technology into a car can be dangerous and even deadly. Everyday technology even tails sometimes such as; cellular devices, computers, kitchen appliances, even cars that already have a touch OT technology.

What make you think that a car with more technology is sated tor you. How can a diverless car be proven to be sated enough to trust a person's lite. It is an accident were to happen, due to a technology malfunction, what will the developers and the ""driver"" use to defend their case with. It is too risky to make a car with so much technology involved.

Second OT all, what is an incident did happen? Whose fault would it be? It is were a normal case, with a normal car, it would be more simple to say which person to blame because both people would be driving. Its technology was involved in the incident, and it was a malfunction, it would be the driverless passenger. Then that passenger would bring up the developers as the one to blame. The developers have more money and more power than the person who bought the car. So they're going to do anything to not be the ones to blame.

Lastly, it is very expensive to keep up with such a luxury car. The parts would be more expensive. The development would be way more expensive. Where are they going to get all that money? How much would it be to purchase one? What if you get into a wreck? How much will it be to get everything fixed? All unanswered questions that people will ask when they're in that situation. All those problems can be avoided by simply buying a car with not as much technology in its interior.

In conclusion, I disagree with the development OT driverless cars. They would be very unsafe. It would be more difficult to figure out who to blame for the accidents if they were caused by a driverless car passenger. And it would be very expensive. Other people would be exulted knowing that they don't have to drive, but keep in mind that a trip to the market, could cause you your lite.
