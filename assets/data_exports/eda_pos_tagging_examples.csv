"Real or Fake Feelings

""Imagine being able to detect exactly hoe other people are feeling, even then they are trying to hide their emotions"" (D'Alto). The article by Nick D'Alto,

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about a née software, the Facial Action Coding System which can recognize emotions based on muscle movements. Some people think this technology can be useful for many industries, however it can have negative effects on some. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

Students may have personal issues, and it is not necessary for classroom's to know the emotions an individual is going through. As the article explains hoe muscle movements connect at hoe someone feels, it states, ""Beckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness..."" ’D'Alto). This demonstrates that the technology can only detect a fee emotion. The technology may get confused, and it could determine an incorrect emotion. The Facial Action Coding System does not offer enough emotions and could therefore make a mistake. In a classroom, students do not need a computer to inform the emotions they feel. Instead, students should learn to communicate hoe they feel at words. Not every emotion should be shared. They may have a problem at home or could be getting bullied. The emotions shown from the technology all just make the case horse. It is not valuable to use technology to understand emotions of others. When the article explains hoe every emotion is universal, it states, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (shoeing no emotion)"" (D'Alto). This statement is not valid because it is not possible to have no emotion. Every thought, question, word, and sentence has emotion. This means the Facial Action Coding System does not have accurate results.

A classroom should not have a piece of technology that has no purpose. Teachers should ask for feedback and have students express their emotion without a device. Technology should not take over feelings. A computer problem could take away jobs of teachers. The Software all only make things horse in the classroom, which proves it is not useful.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable in a classroom because the technology does not provide accurate emotions of students, does not teach students life skills, and it makes the situation horse. Students should focus on communicating at each other and not developing days for humans and computers to communicate.",0,real fake feel imagin abl detect exact hoe peopl feel tri hide emot alto articl nick alto make mona lisa smile née softwar facial action code recogn emot base muscl movement peopl think technolog use industri negat effect use technolog read emot express student classroom valuabl student person issu necessari classroom know emot individu articl explain hoe muscl movement connect hoe feel state beckman classifi basic emot happi surpris anger disgust fear sad alto demonstr technolog detect fee emot technolog confus determin incorrect emot facial action code offer emot make mistak classroom student need comput inform emot feel instead student learn communic hoe feel word emot share problem home bulli emot shown technolog make case hors valuabl use technolog understand emot articl explain hoe emot univers state express compar neutral face shoe emot alto statement valid possibl emot thought question word sentenc emot mean facial action code accur result classroom piec technolog purpos teacher ask feedback student express emot devic technolog feel comput problem away job teacher softwar make thing hors classroom prove use use facial action code valuabl classroom technolog provid accur emot student teach student life skill make situat hors student focus communic develop day human comput communic,200,200.0,0.16,0.415,0.08
"Seeking multiple opinions can help you make better choices. If you do not get information from multiple people you may not get good choices. Talking to more than one person can give you way more information than if you were to not talk to someone at all. Some peoples' advice is better than other peoples advice, so asking multiple people is always the best thing to do. Seeking multiple opinions can help you make better choices because you are getting advice from multiple people who have already made that choice, you may get more choices, which can lead you to better choices, and you can get more information from people who have already made the choice.

Vetting advice from someone else is always a great thing to do. Asking for advice from another person can lead you to get more knowledge on the choice you want to make. The person you may be asking may have already made the choice and can tell you why you should or should not make that choice. Asking another person may give you a reason to not make the choice that you want to make. You should always get advice from another person before making a decision.

Talking to another person can give you more options which may be better for you. Not talking to someone else may lead you to make a bad decision without even knowing it. Talking to multiple people can lead you to way better choices to choose from.

Different people have made different choices and talking to them can give you insight on the choices they have made and what happened due to that choice.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that kids should do community service because they can interact with more people, help the community and feel good afterwards. Community service is not wasting your time when you could be home playing Video games. It's a time when u give up your time to help someone or something in need. I feel that community service would improve some kids self-confidence. When most people do it they were forced by the school or they were with their friends, and they didn't want to be left out. Well that's not how that should be we should take the responsibility to get up and do it. When I do service I think of everyone I'He helped and lies I'He saved, Must by picking up some garbage or re-building a house that was devastate by a hurricane.

Community service sounds like a punishment but it's not it's a reward. You receive an amazing feeling when you have helped someone. It's not Must doing something in your spare time, its giving back to the earth. If we keep living in a world where we litter on beaches and streets we won't have many healthy animals, and we can't grow Vegetables in our backyards because we are too lazy to pick out the weeds. Soon the earth will die not now, but it will if we don't change. If everybody did a little community service the world will be healthy and won't die. The point I'm trying to get across is that community service is helpful it's not a waste of time and shouldn't be forced. But sooner or later if we don't start doing something about the trash community service will have to be forced, to she our planet.

Sincerely,

"Dear, TEACHER_NAME,

TEACHER_NAME I Believe that cell phones need to stay at home because in order for students to get a good education they need not to be distracted by devices such as a cell phone, That is why i think Policy 2 is the best one .

Students in this school should have they're phones left at home because on a test day a student forgot to study him/her texts a friend who already had that class ask him/her for the answers, and that right there is cheating. In order for students to get a good education they need to be well aware of the material in each class study for exams, test etc. and so further more if the students are distracted by they're phones the Teacher who is Teaching that class shall take up the students phone and keep it for five days with a policy of five days at the end of five days they must pay fifteen dollars to get it back. Another reason would be if students are not educated enough and they fail the TAKS test your school will be the lowest in education and there for we the supreme independent district will have to fire you from your current position as school principle. ""PLEASE READ WITH CAUTION!"".

"Do you believe that there is a computer that can examine you on how your feeling? Well believe it or not, there is a computer that can identify your emotions. In the article"" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Here's the big question, do you really think this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?

The Facial Action Coding System is a system for the computer to read your facial expressions. In paragraph 3, the author states,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscles must move human like."" A movement of one or more muscle is called an ""action unit"". The author also mentions that Beckman has classified six basic emotions which include happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

My opinion on the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. Students might not like the idea of it.",0,believ comput examin feel believ comput identifi emot articl make mona lisa smile author describ new technolog facial action code enabl comput identifi human emot big question realli think technolog valuabl read emot express student classroom facial action code comput read facial express paragraph author state process begin comput construct comput model face muscl human like movement muscl action unit author mention beckman classifi basic emot includ happi surpris anger disgust fear sad opinion technolog read emot express student classroom valuabl student like idea,84,84.0,0.14285714285714285,0.3333333333333333,0.08333333333333333
"Have you ever walked outside and taken a deep breath of fresh air, but then you realize that the air you're breathing isn't all that fresh? That's because air pollution has greatly increased in recent years and the number one reason for air pollution is the exhaust from your cars. Yes, the amount of cars in the world has increased dramatically in the last 10 years. While this is good that the luxury of owning an automobile it has also put a burden on the earth and future generations. While cars have made it easier for our day to day limes the amount of pollution in the world has become too high to not do something about it now. Instead of taking the modern convenience of a car what if you decided to ride your bike to work for a change.

The fact that the amount of pollution is ever increasing should be enough of a reason to limit car usage. Instead of driving Emery time you go somewhere if you just rode a bike or walked when its convenient you could make a difference in the world. You don't have to completely stop driving your car but just limit the amount of times you do drive and that little extra effort will make a big difference in the long run. The world is facing an epidemic in which we could not have clean air for our future generations to be able to take their kids to the park and enjoy a nice day in the sun.

Not only is limiting your car usage better for the environment it is also better for your body. When you decide to ride your bike or walk opposed to driving your car you are getting a work out from doing so. This may not seem like much but when you look at how often you go places the numbers start to add up. In the ten minutes that you would take to go to the bank you could spend fifteen minutes riding your bike and getting exercise multiple times throughout the day. Thiss can also time you much more free time to do something physically active that you ignored because of a car, with the motivation to go out pollution free you can start up running or even learn how to skate and enjoy the go.

When you decide to make the change and not drive as much you open up endless possibilities for what you could do instead of sitting in one place driving. You become more active in the community and this helps the environment and you as a person. Limited driving has been proved to be a great idea in more ways than you would think. Just doing your part can help out.

In conclusion the facts are all here that limited car usage is the best way to go for decreasing air pollution and making you a better you. It will help the future become a brighter and cleaner place to lime.",0,walk outsid taken deep breath fresh air realiz air breath fresh air pollut great increas recent year number reason air pollut exhaust car yes car world increas dramat year good luxuri automobil burden earth futur generat car easier day day lime pollut world high instead modern conveni car decid ride bike work chang fact pollut increas reason limit car usag instead drive emeri time rode bike walk conveni make differ world complet stop drive car limit time drive littl extra effort make big differ long run world face epidem clean air futur generat abl kid park enjoy nice day sun limit car usag better environ better bodi decid ride bike walk oppos drive car work like look place number start add minut bank spend minut ride bike exercis multipl time day thiss time free time physic activ ignor car motiv pollut free start run learn skate enjoy decid make chang drive open endless possibl instead sit place drive activ communiti help environ person limit drive prove great idea way think help conclus fact limit car usag best way decreas air pollut make better help futur brighter cleaner place lime,189,190.0,0.16842105263157894,0.4368421052631579,0.1368421052631579
"When you are faced with a problem or a situation that you have to decide what to do, how do you pick the right choice? Would you come up with one your self and just choose that or would you have an idea But seek others opinions first Before acting? Whichever one you are, I'm here to tell you the advantages of seeking others opinions first Before acting out.

The first thing your wondering might EE why seeking others opinion's helps. Well you would get more opinions of something that your unsure about. You could also get feedback on your choice to truly decide if it is right or not. But if we are talking about getting others opinions in writing than, they could see errors and spelling problems that maybe you don't catch, or the computer doesn't catch. Finally, to appeal to more people, you could tweak your writing Eased on other people's opinions to include more thoughts.

The outcome of receiving other opinions towards your actions are, you'll EE more reflective and relate AELE towards other people. Meaning, you'll EE AELE to agree and converse about more topics rather than just Being self-centered. Your writing includes multiple ideas and personalities in your writing. Lastly, your choices are changed Eased on other people Because you will think, what would so-and-so think if they were in my shoes right now.

Your mental and physical health also are affected EY the opinions of others. For instance, when deciding in the future you will lean to other people or think about what someone else would do Before deciding what is right. When talking about more physical health rather than mental health, you will act more considerately and thoughtful around others instead of selfishly.

The effects of this could EE that your taking in others ideas, so you will tend to consider them in similar incidents when you have to choose either the right or the wrong. You might also act more thoughtful too others Because you learn their opinions which might change your overall mindset. All of this leading too you Being an Better person in general and giving you a thoughtful and more considerate mindset rather than a selfish and self centered one. So the takeaway is that it doesn't take much to Broaden your mindset and make you an Better person, you just need to think of others maybe a little more than you used too.",0,face problem situat decid pick right choic come self choos idea seek opinion act whichev tell advantag seek opinion act thing wonder seek opinion help opinion unsur feedback choic truli decid right talk opinion write error spell problem mayb catch comput catch final appeal peopl tweak write eas peopl opinion includ thought outcom receiv opinion action reflect relat ael peopl mean ael agre convers topic self center write includ multipl idea person write choic chang eas peopl think think shoe right mental physic health affect opinion instanc decid futur lean peopl think decid right talk physic health mental health act consider thought instead selfish effect idea tend consid similar incid choos right wrong act thought learn opinion chang overal mindset lead better person general thought consider mindset selfish self center takeaway broaden mindset make better person need think mayb littl use,141,141.0,0.2127659574468085,0.4326241134751773,0.1347517730496454
"Online clause have been becoming a popular thing, and I use some reason why they are. Online clause are cheaper, can be flexible, can make an student gain confidence, and allow for multitasking. This all benefit the student in some way, whether it IU very big or not. I personally agree with those who day online clause benefit students, and with good reason to support my decision. Though some place don't support online clause, there always other place to try out at that may offer similar clause to those you want to attend online, and they might have better benefit than thou eat a different school.

To begin this all off, money IU a crucial thing in life no matter who you are. The people that are most affected by money problem are students, and this IU due to Claus and material out. Online clause are about 3550 percent cheaper in some place. This IU great for those who don't have enough money to attend a Claus at the actual school. If you ever plan on attending an online Claus, always check the price compared to going to the campus or school in person. This can help you think about which clause to take and at which place. Online clause can also cut down on the out of material needed for the Claus you want to take online. Though they may seem not worth it, an online Claus can cut the out of a Claus by a lot, and this in turn help the student pay for required material he may need for the Claus to attend it.

Secondly, online clause are flexible most of the time. This IU great for those who have to bend their schedule an some to fit in some Claus time during the week. Not only that, but online clause have even been shown to allow students to get job and make some money while they are attending there clause for things they need to advance in life. Online clause can even be scheduled nowadays, but that feature IU only at some schools. This flexibility may come in handy for when you need to get a check-up, or even if you have an serious medical issue and need to find out what it IU. Au a note though, always check to use if the Claus IU very flexible, and this IU due to being able to have time to make up for what you Miku. And Au I have been, many complain that clause are not flexible by much if not at all. This IU due to the fact of whom teacher the Claus, what Claus it IU, and the school itself. Always make sure you double-check the teacher, the Claus, and the school itself to use if it IU flexible enough for you to attend it without feeling too confined or inflexible. Scientific research show that this feeling can lower an students work effort by almost 100 percent. That IU why you must always auk if a Claus flexible enough for you to take without feeling confined.

Thirdly, Online clause can allow a person to feel left why and gain confidence. Shyness IU something students have a lot of. In fact, almost 60 percent of students have some shyness in them if not at all. This shyness can affect if not ruin the Claus, making new friend, and even doing classwork with other students when needed. Online clause can solve this AU they can give an venue of friendliness towards stranger. Though many complain that they are not why and need to talk with someone in person, online clause can help those who tend to be more why than other are. This allow even moderately why students the ability to focus on their Claus, or clause, and not worry about having to be why towards teacher and fellow students.

Finally, online clause can help with multitasking. Multitasking IU a crucial thing in life for you will need to do it most of your life anyway. From running errand to visiting your doctor on the game day, online clause are able to allow time for multitasking. In 2009, they found out those who did online clause multitask better than those who were always on campus to take the game Claus. This IU very good since multitasking IU a crucial life kill, and online clause can help this at home. When at home online clause can allow a person to do his laundry, clean his house, and even do dishes and still be in Claus. Another reason for multitasking IU that it can improve your flexibility by at least 25 percent, and that IU great for those who need to fit in time for other things in life such AU exercise.

Au I mentioned, online clause are popular and do benefit students. They do this by helping cut out and help have them money for things they need most in life, flexibility to make up work and to do things that they need to in life, help an student build or gain confidence, and allow for multitasking. This all help an student get through a Claus by improving the Claus conditions, or by making it more comfortable for them emotionally. Though online clause aren't in person and some clause are not very flexible, they can help why students feel left worried. And Au I mentioned Au well, there are a lot of schools that may offer the game Claus with better flexibility than the school you want to go for that Claus.

Overall, online clause can help an student get through a Claus cheaply, confidently, with flexibility, and with the ability of multitasking. ",0,onlin claus popular thing use reason onlin claus cheaper flexibl make student gain confid allow multitask benefit student way big person agre day onlin claus benefit student good reason support decis place support onlin claus place tri offer similar claus want attend onlin better benefit thou eat differ school begin money crucial thing life matter peopl affect money problem student claus materi onlin claus percent cheaper place great money attend claus actual school plan attend onlin claus check price compar campus school person help think claus place onlin claus cut materi need claus want onlin worth onlin claus cut claus lot turn help student pay requir materi need claus attend second onlin claus flexibl time great bend schedul fit claus time week onlin claus shown allow student job make money attend claus thing need advanc life onlin claus schedul nowaday featur school flexibl come handi need check medic issu need note check use claus flexibl abl time make miku complain claus flexibl fact teacher claus claus school make sure doubl check teacher claus school use flexibl attend feel confin inflex scientif research feel lower student work effort percent auk claus flexibl feel confin onlin claus allow person feel left gain confid shyness student lot fact percent student shyness shyness affect ruin claus make new friend classwork student need onlin claus solv venu friendli stranger complain need talk person onlin claus help tend allow moder student abil focus claus claus worri teacher fellow student final onlin claus help multitask multitask crucial thing life need life run errand visit doctor game day onlin claus abl allow time multitask onlin claus multitask better campus game claus good multitask crucial life kill onlin claus help home home onlin claus allow person laundri clean hous dish claus reason multitask improv flexibl percent great need fit time thing life exercis mention onlin claus popular benefit student help cut help money thing need life flexibl make work thing need life help student build gain confid allow multitask help student claus improv claus condit make comfort emot onlin claus person claus flexibl help student feel left worri mention lot school offer game claus better flexibl school want claus overal onlin claus help student claus cheapli confid flexibl abil multitask,371,371.0,0.1752021563342318,0.5121293800539084,0.11320754716981132

"For year, the united State haw been maw producing and using car. It may Wound Surprising, but America haw already reached it peak when it come to buying car (Source 4). More and more people around the globe have begun to realize the benefit of using alternative mean of transportation. Place Such aw Vauban, Bogota, Paris, and even New York have implemented program to encourage the limited we of car. The idea of giving up Such a comfort may Wound tragic at first, but reducing car usage haw many advantage.

We we car every day for pretty basic purpose. To get to work or School or to run errand are just a few example. Now, imagine what would happen if a car were not available to you. It probably would not be the end of the world. You could catch a BUW or AWK for a ride from Somebody. If you really needed to, you could even ride your bike or walk to wherever you needed to go. People in the part tended to fear using alternative transport, for varying reason. Maybe friend or family are not willing to give ride. Maybe the Where thought of walking a mile may Week terrifying or ridiculous. The most common reason in probably that having a car in just too covenant, it Week that there in no need for any other way of transportation! But life can and Would be adjusted to fit into there Source of transport. In Vauban, Germany, for example, residents have given up their car in favor of a life without them (Source 1). I just proved that contrary to popular belief, car Ware actually not a necessity!

Citizens in Vauban, Germany walk or ride bicycle when they need to go Someplace (Source 1). It's almost needle WW to Way this, but they have a much healthier lifestyle than most crowned in the united State! They are not afraid of walking or riding a bike a bit to get where they need to. Not only are there people in better physical Shape, but one mother, Harm Walter, tells UW that when The had a car, The was always tense, but now that The haw given it up, The Week happier (Source 1). Carlos Arturo Plaza, in Bogota, Columbia, Way that using his bike on their annual NOTAR day reduce his Strewn level. There in a direct correlation between physical activity and mental wellbeing. The more activity, the better you feel. By limiting car usage, we are also encouraging the physical exercise that come in place of it, making UW a happier, healthier community.

Maybe the most important reason to reduce car usage in to protect our environment. By obtaining and burning fossil fuel, we are both running out of this resource and owing the threat of Will and air pollution to our environment. The gasoline we we to fill our car certainly won't last forever. It won't even last for much longer at the rate we are burning it at. Also, Will can be departing to the ecosystem it impact, aw we have Weened in the part, for example the BP oil Will. Perhaps the biggest disadvantage to the gasoline we we to fill our car in the air pollution it leave behind. Transportation in the Second leading Source of emission in the HS, behind power plant (Source 4). Also, in Paris, the Smog from automobile got to be To bad that they Wet law to ban car Won certain day (Source 2). Just by reducing car usage for a few day, the Smog cleared tremendously. It wouldn't be hard at all for each individual in this community to cut back on the amount of time they Spend driving in their car, if for no other reason than to keep our Earth clean.

Over the year, we American have grown accustomed to relying on car for our every need, but we can't do that anymore. AW a community, we need to open our eye and Wee the change happening around UW. Car Ware not a necessity. We don't even need to completely get rid of them, but it in necessary for UW to cut back, for the Wake of our health and our environment. It may take Some getting used to, but I promise, it in more than possible. In the word of Bill Ford, we can Won move forward to a world where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private car, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to Wave time, conserve resources, lower emission, and improve Weighted.""

Limiting car usage has numerous advantages that can positively impact both individuals and the environment. In recent years, there has been a growing trend to separate suburban life from auto use, and this movement, known as ""smart planning"", has shown great potential in improving overall quality of life and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. By limiting car usage, communities can become more compact, accessible, and environmentally friendly.

One of the main advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a significant percentage of these emissions, with passenger cars alone accounting for 12 percent in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. This is a huge impediment to efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. By limiting car usage and promoting alternative modes of transportation, such as walking, biking, and public transportation, communities can significantly decrease their carbon footprint.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the improvement of overall air quality. In cities like Paris, where smog has become a major issue, partial driving bans have been enforced to clear the air. During these bans, congestion has decreased significantly and the levels of smog have reduced. This not only improves the health and well-being of the residents but also creates a more pleasant and livable environment. By limiting car usage, cities can combat air pollution and create cleaner and healthier spaces for their inhabitants.

Limiting car usage also has social and economic benefits. In the German suburb of Vauban, where residents have given up their cars, 70 percent of families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move into the community. This has created a more relaxed and stress-free atmosphere, as residents no longer have to worry about the hassles of car ownership and the constant traffic congestion. Additionally, limiting car usage can promote more compact communities with walkable streets and accessible public transportation. Stores are placed closer to residential areas, making it more convenient for people to access essential services without having to rely on cars. This can have a positive impact on local businesses and economies.

In conclusion, limiting car usage has numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and creating more compact and accessible communities, limiting car usage can help combat climate change, promote healthier living, and create more vibrant and livable spaces. It is an essential step towards creating a sustainable future.",1,advantag limit car usag limit car usag numer advantag posit impact individu environ recent year grow trend separ suburban life auto use movement known smart plan shown great potenti improv overal qualiti life reduc greenhous gas emiss limit car usag communiti compact access environment friend main advantag limit car usag reduct greenhous gas emiss car respons signific percentag emiss passeng car account percent europ percent car intens area unit state huge impedi effort reduc greenhous gas emiss combat climat chang limit car usag promot altern mode transport walk bike public transport communiti signific decreas carbon footprint advantag limit car usag improv overal air qualiti citi like pari smog major issu partial drive ban enforc clear air ban congest decreas signific level smog reduc improv health resid creat pleasant livabl environ limit car usag citi combat air pollut creat cleaner healthier space inhabit limit car usag social econom benefit german suburb vauban resid given car percent famili car percent sold car communiti creat relax stress free atmospher resid longer worri hassl car ownership constant traffic congest addit limit car usag promot compact communiti walkabl street access public transport store place closer residenti area make conveni peopl access essenti servic reli car posit impact local busi economi conclus limit car usag numer advantag individu communiti environ reduc greenhous gas emiss improv air qualiti creat compact access communiti limit car usag help combat climat chang promot healthier live creat vibrant livabl space essenti step creat sustain futur,244,244.0,0.06147540983606557,0.45081967213114754,0.18442622950819673
"The Electoral College is a really good process that I think they should keep. This Electoral college was found by the founding fathers and it is used so that the citizens could vote and the congress. The citizens get to have the right to vote on who they want to be presidant. After everyone voted the votes are counted up in each state and it shows which states voted for different people. The congress have a meeting of the electors and get to all vote. All votes for the congress are counted out seperatly then citizens. This is a the start of why I think Electoral College is fair and equal all around.

In order for the Electoral College to elect a presidant they need 270 votes out of 538 Electors. Each state or country has electors in them. The candidates running for presidant have their own electors. Every 4 years a presidential election is held at the same time on tuesday after the first monday of novemeber. When voting for the candidates you are basically voting for the candidates electors. After voting in the election the governor makes a ""Certificate of Ascertainment,"" which is the list of the candidates who ran for presidant. Also, it shows who the winning candidate is in each state. Lastly the certificate is sent to the states congress to keep for records.

There are mainly 5 reasons in why the Electoral College should stay. First is the Certainty of Outcome which shows that there cant be a dispute because it is based on popular vote. The next reason is Everyone is Presidant, this means that the presidential candidate has trans-regional appeal. Another reason is Swing Sates which is the winner take all method. They are usually whatching campaigns and really listen to the other candidates, thoses poeple are usually thoughtfull voters. The next great reason is Big States, this shows if you win a big state then you win more electoral votes and each big state has more electoral votes. The last reason is Avoid Run Off Elections, this avoids the problem of no candidates recieves a majority of the votes in the east.

Their are alot of great reasonings about electoral college but there are some bad reasonings to. Voters dont vote for the presidant when they vote, they vote for the elcectors and the electors vote for the presidant. This can mean that even if you voted for the specific presidant your vote shows you voted for the 30 or so congress people voting for presidant. What if there was a tie in the electoral vote then the election would be for the House of Representitves where they vote for presidant. The 55 representitive votes are equal to 35 million voters. This shows that the electoral college can be bad for the voters.

After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            ",0,elector colleg realli good process think elector colleg father use citizen vote congress citizen right vote want presid vote vote count state state vote differ peopl congress meet elector vote vote congress count seperat citizen start think elector colleg fair equal order elector colleg elect presid need vote elector state countri elector candid run presid elector year presidenti elect held time tuesday monday novemeb vote candid basic vote candid elector vote elect governor make certif ascertain list candid ran presid win candid state certif sent state congress record main reason elector colleg stay certainti outcom disput base popular vote reason presid mean presidenti candid tran region appeal reason swing sate winner method usual whatch campaign realli listen candid poepl usual thoughtful voter great reason big state win big state win elector vote big state elector vote reason avoid run elect avoid problem candid reciev major vote east alot great reason elector colleg bad reason voter dont vote presid vote vote elcector elector vote presid mean vote specif presid vote vote congress peopl vote presid tie elector vote elect hous representitv vote presid representit vote equal million voter elector colleg bad voter read articl believ elector colleg great idea great thing thing dislik perfect elector colleg tri way presid vote year hope stay like long time reason thought elector colleg right way,221,222.0,0.11711711711711711,0.5315315315315315,0.2072072072072072
"Based on the articles for"" Carefree Cities"", not having or limiting Car usage will not only Change our lives, but it Could also make our Cities a better place to live. As Harm Walter says

""When I had a Car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""

source 1. We Could all agree that when we are driving we are mostly worried about if we Could Crash or no, if we might get a ticket, this Causes us to be tense and might affect our health. So why not just leave the Car for a minute and walk or use a bicycle?

Limiting Car usage will also improve the Conditions of our environment, by not using Cars as much as we do we Can reduce greenhouse gases, which Could help preserve the ozone layer. According to source 2 ''

After days of rerecord pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to Clear the air of global City''

. If in some days a big City Could reduce the amount of air pollution by a partial driving ban, imagine what will happen if the amount of driving Cars is reduce for years. Reducing Car usage Could also help our health, studies show that the people that are sitting most of the day are most likely to get Cancer, most of the people out there are driving all day and they don't do any type of exercise.

In Conclusion, let me just emphasize that reducing Car usage will bring positive Changes not only to our lives but to our environment. As a businessman from Colombia name Carlos says'

'It's a good opportunity to take away streets a lower air pollution""

(source 3). All around the world people are leaving and selling their Cars, according to the sources. In Germany, Paris, and Colombia they all have or had Carefree Cities for a day. As we Can see all of those people had positive Changes in their lives the minute they left the Car. Why don't we just try to be Carefree for a day and see how better you will feel.  By going one day without Cars we Could also support president Obama's ambitious goals to Curb the United States greenhouse gas emissions

"When were Rating for president were not technically Rating for the present in fact we are Rating for the slate of electors. The electors can be anyone without a public holding office. Electoral college process is not a good processes for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular Rote; on the other hand, he could hare the minority of the electoral college Notes. That president would lose the election even though he technically had the most Notes. We should change the process into popular Notes for the president.

The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong', by Bradford Plume it quoted, Back in 1960,segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a popular Rote for Kennedy would not hare actually gone to Kennedy). The election would hare gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college is way too risky to take on. Just simply a couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election.

The electoral college is an unfair process because of the winnertakeall system. In the article called What Is The Electoral College"", by the office of the Federal register it quoted most states hare a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong', by Bradford Plume it quoted, candidates don't spend time in states they know they hare no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral college is an unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is an unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slight change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.

In conclusion, The electoral college is an unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular Rote. Obviously popular Notes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winner takes it all process counterfeits the number of American citizens Rating result. Electoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean Notes that'll actually be fair for once.

"The break between school years is a time For students to prepare themselves For the year to come. It can be interred that children tend to put school in the back ow their mind during this period. This is understandable but middle and high school students continue to learn: this is with the help ow various projects and work given to students to work on during their break. The summer reading projects that are given to most grades keep the mind in a working state allowing For the transition between school years to be easier For students and teachers. Student designed projects are more Favorable to teacher designed projects because it allows For the student to be creative as well as coming across as mature and responsible.

Creativity is a characteristic, which is more often then now, seen to be taught and picked up on at young ages. OW course, there is high school art classes or projects in general given to children during the year to get their creative minds working. Most ow the time though, the projects given are somewhat limited in how they can appear or the topic ow what the project is based on because they are most likely teacher designed. As a matter ow Wait, certain school classes have more projects than others, but there is not a lot ow student designed work. As For summer reading projects, the Ã¡ÂºâodÃÂ¶ list is often restricted to a handful ow books then the students have to look a little past the words to get a deeper meaning behind the lines For a Finished project. Giving school attendees a project that gives them Well control over the design, the Final product, and how the project is presented can really boost the studentÃâº summer. The creativity that would be provided can really improve a studentÃâº summer as a whole.

Maturity and responsibility come with age. This is often tested a lot during apersonÃâº life, and it can be tested during school as well to see how War a child is progressing. Summer projects are given to keep the children working during the summer. There are many reasons why this is true, but some students do not want to think during summer. Giving this type ow student a teacher designed project can allow them to breeze past the summer project. Therefore, not benefiting them in any way, shape or Worm. Giving out a student designed project needs more brain power to actually become a Finished product. The responsibility given to students with a project ran by them can separate the more mature children ow the bunch and the lesser half. Being able to Finish a school project during the summer takes dedication, but involves a lot more accountability and maturity to complete a project created, thought out, and produced by them.

The creativity and responsibility needed to Finish a project designed by the student given the project, by War, surpasses the benefits ow a teacher designed summer project. Both ow these projects are given over the summer to keep students learning during summer break, but teacher designed projects are often Favored. This is because the work given usually pertains to the curriculum to get the studentÃâº prepared For the year to come. However, it is much superior to give a student the opportunity to show how mature they can be, how responsible they are, and also show how well their mind works by itself: creativity. It is clear which choice is better For the student to keep their mind up: having them design their own project, but it will only take time to see when student designed summer projects will be implemented into various school systems around the globe. ",0,break school year time student prepar year come inter children tend school mind period understand middl high school student continu learn help various project work given student work break summer read project given grade mind work state allow transit school year easier student teacher student design project favor teacher design project allow student creativ come matur respons creativ characterist seen taught pick young age cours high school art class project general given children year creativ mind work time project given somewhat limit appear topic project base like teacher design matter wait certain school class project lot student design work summer read project ã¡âºâodãâ¶ list restrict hand book student look littl past word deeper mean line finish project school attende project control design final product project present realli boost studentã âº summer creativ provid realli improv studentã âº summer matur respons come age test lot apersonã âº life test school war child progress summer project given children work summer reason true student want think summer type student teacher design project allow breez past summer project benefit way shape worm student design project need brain power actual finish product respons given student project ran separ matur children bunch lesser half abl finish school project summer dedic involv lot account matur complet project creat thought produc creativ respons need finish project design student given project war surpass benefit teacher design summer project project given summer student learn summer break teacher design project favor work given usual pertain curriculum studentã âº prepar year come superior student opportun matur respons mind work creativ clear choic better student mind design project time student design summer project implement various school globe,274,274.0,0.13503649635036497,0.6934306569343066,0.08029197080291971
"In recent years, the debate surrounding cell phone usage in schools has become increasingly polarizing. On the one hand, many educators and parents stand firmly against widespread usage, arguing that exposure to the constant distractions of phones harms academic performance. On the other hand, some argue that with certain restrictions in place, cell phones offer students newfound communication capabilities and freedom away from the watchful eyes of parents and faculty. 

When it comes to allowing students to bring their phones to school, particularly for times such as lunch breaks and free periods, there are both pros and cons that must be taken into account. Proponents of the allowance are quick to cite the usefulness of cell phones in allowing students to stay connected with their academic lies, stay safe, and find mental flagship away from the hustle and bustle of school. Opponents, however, claim that allowing phones in the building poses a threat to the morale of the school environment, and that it can be too easily abused and ultimately interfere with students' educational experiences.

At the end of the day, whether a principal should allow students to bring cell phones to school boils down to his or her individual discretion. Each principal must take into account the potential costs and benefits of allowing cell phones into the school and weigh them in regard to his or her own unique situation. By taking a nuanced and thoughtful approach to understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a cell phone allowance, principals can make sure they make the best decision for their school.",1,recent year debat surround cell phone usag school increas polar hand educ parent stand firm widespread usag argu exposur constant distract phone harm academ perform hand argu certain restrict place cell phone offer student newfound communic capabl freedom away watch eye parent faculti come allow student bring phone school particular time lunch break free period pros taken account propon allow quick cite use cell phone allow student stay connect academ lie stay safe mental flagship away hustl bustl school oppon claim allow phone build pose threat moral school environ easili abus ultim interfer student educ experi end day princip allow student bring cell phone school boil individu discret princip account potenti cost benefit allow cell phone school weigh regard uniqu situat nuanc thought approach understand strength weak cell phone allow princip make sure make best decis school,137,137.0,0.1386861313868613,0.5328467153284672,0.16058394160583941
"Imagine the last few days of school when you're just about ready to enter summer break, but you remember that you have summer projects to do over the break. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they will continue learning during the break. Knowing they are school related projects, most are teacher-designed but since they're given to students over their summer break, they should be student-designed. Students could include their interests, in relation to some educational topics, and they would be most likely to do it. Projects over the summer seem like a waste of time and effort, but would that thought change if students created and designed them?

Summer projects could still be educational with involving the students likes and interests. Kids and teens around the same age have common interests, they know what they enjoy and what they don't. Since they have friends they were planning to spend time with, they could create group projects to complete them with and it would start to feel less like school work. Some students were probably looking forward to break and no school, but didn't have any big plans for the summer. The assignments could be a big help to those to enjoy and better their summer by having some sort of fun and enjoyment. With their interests and likes in mind, student-designed summer projects would encourage students to actually complete them. They could see something in the directions of the assignments that can potentially catch their attention. Most projects are a learning experience and there are some students who aren't good at paying attention or listening at school. While they're completing their projects, they could come to the realization that they enjoy learning new material and other school related things.

Although student-designed summer projects sounds like a good idea, teacher-designed projects could be a lot more beneficial. They could help us prepare for the next school year or grade level and give us a head start. Teachers include more useful information and content in their assignments and of course they know what is best for their students learning wise.

Closing my take on this position, I greatly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed. Teachers are the ones creating the projects now, but students are not enjoying or completing them. Teens and children could still be receiving their learning experience while involving their interests. It could also increase the amount of students completing their assignments. Teacher-designed summer projects could be a little more helpful; however, students deserve to enjoy and have fun on their break. ",0,imagin day school readi enter summer break rememb summer project break school requir student complet summer project assur continu learn break know school relat project teacher design given student summer break student design student includ relat educ topic like project summer like wast time effort thought chang student creat design summer project educ involv student like kid teen age common know enjoy friend plan spend time creat group project complet start feel like school work student probabl look forward break school big plan summer assign big help enjoy better summer sort fun enjoy like mind student design summer project encourag student actual complet direct assign potenti catch attent project learn experi student good pay attent listen school complet project come realize enjoy learn new materi school relat thing student design summer project sound like good idea teacher design project lot benefici help prepar school year grade level head start teacher includ use inform content assign cours know best student learn wise close posit great believ summer assign student design teacher creat project student enjoy complet teen children receiv learn experi involv increas student complet assign teacher design summer project littl help student deserv enjoy fun break,196,196.0,0.1377551020408163,0.6683673469387755,0.10714285714285714
"NASA has done a lot of research on the planet we call Mars. Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking one spacecraft was taking photos of landing sites for Viking two. They found a human face. Some say that this face was created by aliens. I think it is just a natural landform.

First, mesas are common in Colonia. As the text says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia."" The shadows made it look like the landform had eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are just shadows. Only few Scientists thought that the Face was an Alien artifact.

Secondly, they took pictures and said that the face was just a landform. After they first saw the face, they wanted to take pictures as soon as possible. NASA flew the Mars Global Surveyor over Colonia. As the article says,"" Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos."" That means those pictures were more accurate. These photos resulted that the Face was just a natural landform.

Lastly, scientists said that it was the same as landforms around the American west. Mission controller, Gavin, said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This is showing that the landforms here, are on Mars. Aliens didn't make our landforms though. The Face is actually a mesa or a butte and not an Alien artifact.

Some might say, that the second time, in 1998, the camera had to look through the clouds in order to see the face. This is true but, Mission control prepared to look again and went back in 2001. This time the camera had absolute maximum resolution. The text states that, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking Photo."" This camera saw very clearly and saw that it was a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion, scientists say the Face is just a landform. I agree with them and think that it's just a landform. There are even pictures to prove that it was not an Alien artifact.

"Title: A Future Without Cars: Environmental and Lifestyle Advantages

As the global community grapples with the far-reaching impacts of climate change, a shift in lifestyle practices is paramount. One approach towards sustainable living is limiting car usage, which offers extensive benefits for the environment, health, and daily life. 

Prominent within the environmental justifications for reduced car usage are the considerable decreases in greenhouse gas emissions. As described in Elizabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", residential communities like Vauban, Germany, have significantly reduced their carbon footprint by segregating suburban life from car use. Despite cars' centrality to suburban life, they constitute a massive 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe (Rosenthal). In more car-intensive U.S. areas, they may even reach up to 50 percent. By eliminating or limiting car use, communities can play a critical role in managing global CO2 levels.

Aside from environmental considerations, imposing limitations on vehicles can significantly improve public health, the urban landscape, and overall quality of life. Rosenthal's account of the Vauban suburb elucidates the shift in lifestyle unrestricted by cars. Life without cars promotes an active, sustainable lifestyle that utilizes public transportation, bicycles, and pedestrian-friendly amenities, resulting in a healthier population. Similarly, in her report ""The End of Car Culture,"" Rosenthal cites how younger generations are adapting to this change. Studies suggest an increasing tendency for young people to forgo driver's licenses, opting for public transportation or carpooling instead, promoting an active and socially cohesive lifestyle.

Major urban environments like Paris and Bogotá reiterate this sentiment. In Robert Duffer's ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog"", Paris witnessed a 60 percent decrease in traffic congestion following a temporary driving ban. This experiment, albeit brief, demonstrated the potential capabilities of ""car reduced"" communities to revolutionize city landscapes. Furthermore, Andrew Silky's report ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" 
serves as further evidence for the practicality of such an approach. During their annual 'Day Without Cars', Bogotá pedestrians, cyclists, and public transit users took over the cities traffic-free streets.

Clearly, minimizing car usage offers substantial environmental and lifestyle benefits. However, opposition rooted in traditional car-centric values is inevitable. Consequently, transitioning approaches to transportation requires careful legislation, community encouragement, and the promotion of healthier and environmentally sustainable living practice. As cities worldwide continue to experiment and implement these changes, it is becoming apparent that the move away from excessive car usage may not only be beneficial but essential for our society's future health and prosperity.",1,titl futur car environment lifestyl advantag global communiti grappl far reach impact climat chang shift lifestyl practic paramount approach sustain live limit car usag offer extens benefit environ health daili life promin environment justif reduc car usag consider decreas greenhous gas emiss describ elizabeth rosenth articl german suburb life goe car residenti communiti like vauban germani signific reduc carbon footprint segreg suburban life car use despit car central suburban life constitut massiv percent greenhous gas emiss europ rosenth car intens area reach percent elimin limit car use communiti play critic role manag global level asid environment consider impos limit vehicl signific improv public health urban landscap overal qualiti life rosenth account vauban suburb elucid shift lifestyl unrestrict car life car promot activ sustain lifestyl util public transport bicycl pedestrian friend amen result healthier popul similar report end car cultur rosenth cite younger generat adapt chang studi suggest increas tendenc young peopl forgo driver licens opt public transport carpool instead promot activ social cohes lifestyl major urban environ like pari bogotá reiter sentiment robert duffer pari ban drive smog pari wit percent decreas traffic congest follow temporari drive ban experi albeit brief demonstr potenti capabl car reduc communiti revolution citi landscap furthermor andrew silki report car free day spin big hit bogotá serv evid practic approach annual day car bogotá pedestrian cyclist public transit user took citi traffic free street clear minim car usag offer substanti environment lifestyl benefit opposit root tradit car centric valu inevit consequ transit approach transport requir care legisl communiti encourag promot healthier environment sustain live practic citi worldwid continu experi implement chang appar away excess car usag benefici essenti societi futur health prosper,277,277.0,0.10108303249097472,0.3971119133574007,0.1624548736462094

Asking for advice can be a great tool for learning and making wiser decisions. It can help us avoid mistakes and, in many circumstances, overturn mistakes we have already made. We have all heard stories of people seeking counsel and going on to make wise decisions; some have even gone on to achieve great feats. For example, in 2010 Zana Briski sought advice from a photojournalist during a challenging time and, with this advice, she went on to win the Academy Award for Best Documentary. 

The potential risks of not seeking advice can be catastrophic, especially when facing tough times. Taking risks without seeking the wisdom of those with more experience can lead to disastrous outcomes. It is important to remember that those in our life have been through similar experiences in the past and can give invaluable advice that would not have been obtained otherwise. Therefore, never be afraid to ask questions and seek the guidance of an older person. Their advice can bring perspective and direction for tough times and help us make better decisions.

"Phones, Cars

Should people have the privilege and/or the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car? While there are some good reasons why you should have the right, there are some things that people just can't help.

We already can't stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and nowadays more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don't even realize that there even doing it and most care nowadays have the Bluetooth or people sell Bluetooth devices, so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on ""MythBusters"" changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the time it works but some of the times it doesn't under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or ""fine print"" and they can just say oh well it's like a Bluetooth, but it wasn't type of stuff and the court can't do anything about it.

Chis are what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don't care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the proof that they were on it meaning the phone or not.

They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an saturation it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.

Chis are what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.

"Working with a group on a particular assignment can have numerous benefits, both in terms of individual learning and the overall success of the project. When students work together, they can share ideas, skills, and resources, leading to a more comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the topic.

One of the main advantages of working with a group is the diversity of perspectives and experiences. Each member brings their unique viewpoint to the table, which can lead to a more nuanced and thoughtful approach to the assignment. For example, a group of students working on a science project may have different strengths and weaknesses, such as one student being an expert in biology and another in chemistry. By working together, they can create a more complete and accurate understanding of the topic.

Another benefit of working with a group is the ability to divide tasks and responsibilities. When each member has a specific role and task, the workload is distributed more evenly, and no one person is overwhelmed with the entire project. This also helps to develop important skills such as communication, collaboration, and time management.

The group leader plays a crucial role in ensuring the success of the assignment. They are responsible for coordinating the efforts of the group, setting goals and deadlines, and mediating any conflicts that may arise. The leader should also be able to communicate effectively with each member of the group and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Working with a group can also lead to a sense of accountability and motivation. When students know that they are working towards a common goal with their peers, they are more likely to stay on track and complete the assignment. This can also lead to a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, which can be a valuable experience for building relationships and learning how to work with others.

In conclusion, working with a group on a particular assignment can have numerous benefits, including the sharing of ideas and resources, the division of tasks and responsibilities, the development of important skills, and the sense of accountability and motivation. By working together, students can create a more comprehensive and well-rounded understanding of the topic and develop important skills that will serve them well in the future.",1,work group particular assign numer benefit term individu learn overal success project student work share idea skill resourc lead comprehens round understand topic main advantag work group divers perspect experi member bring uniqu viewpoint tabl lead nuanc thought approach assign exampl group student work scienc project differ strength weak student expert biolog chemistri work creat complet accur understand topic benefit work group abil divid task respons member specif role task workload distribut person overwhelm entir project help develop import skill communic collabor time manag group leader play crucial role ensur success assign respons coordin effort group set goal deadlin mediat conflict aris leader abl communic effect member group ensur page work group lead sens account motiv student know work common goal peer like stay track complet assign lead sens camaraderi teamwork valuabl experi build relationship learn work conclus work group particular assign numer benefit includ share idea resourc divis task respons develop import skill sens account motiv work student creat comprehens round understand topic develop import skill serv futur,169,169.0,0.15976331360946747,0.5680473372781065,0.10059171597633136
"“Smog in Paris” is a headline that seems to be appearing more frequently in the news. The high levels of pollution in Paris were so severe that a partial driving ban had to be implemented, with motorists with even-numbered plates being forbidden from driving on Monday, and odd-numbered plates on Tuesday. This move was made to reduce traffic congestion, which was believed to be one of the primary causes of smog. The ban resulted in a 60% decrease in road traffic, and the quality of the air improved so much by Monday that the ban was lifted for Tuesday.

The primary cause of smog in Paris is the presence of diesel vehicles, which emit more harmful pollutants than petrol cars. Due to tax benefits, diesel is the most popular fuel in France. However, diesel emits more fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxide than petrol, both of which are harmful to human health. The high levels of particulate matter in Paris have led to the city having some of the worst air pollution levels in Europe, with levels higher than other cities like London and Brussels.

The driving ban had many positive impacts on the environment and the health of the inhabitants of Paris. The reduced traffic led to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, which is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. Additionally, the reduced traffic led to an improvement in the air quality of the city, which can have a significant impact on the health of its residents. The smog caused by traffic pollution can lead to respiratory problems, allergies, and even cancer. By reducing traffic, the health of Parisians is protected.

Despite the many environmental and health benefits of the driving ban, some were not pleased with the restrictions. Delivery companies, in particular, complained that the restrictions would make it difficult for them to deliver products. However, exceptions were made for eco-friendly and high-occupancy vehicles, which were still allowed to enter the city. Additionally, public transport was free from Friday to Monday, which encouraged more people to use it, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road.

In conclusion, the driving ban in Paris had many positive impacts. By reducing traffic, the ban led to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, which can help to mitigate climate change. Additionally, the ban led to an improvement in air quality, which is vital for the health of the residents of Paris. Although there were some complaints, the restrictions were necessary to protect the environment and the health of Parisians. By implementing such measures, we can help to reduce pollution levels and create a better, healthier future for everyone.",1,“smog paris” headlin appear frequent news high level pollut pari sever partial drive ban implement motorist number plate forbidden drive monday odd number plate tuesday reduc traffic congest believ primari caus smog ban result decreas road traffic qualiti air improv monday ban lift tuesday primari caus smog pari presenc diesel vehicl emit harm pollut petrol car tax benefit diesel popular fuel franc diesel emit fine particul matter nitrogen oxid petrol harm human health high level particul matter pari led citi worst air pollut level europ level higher citi like london brussel drive ban posit impact environ health inhabit pari reduc traffic led decreas carbon dioxid emiss primari greenhous gase respons climat chang addit reduc traffic led improv air qualiti citi signific impact health resid smog caus traffic pollut lead respiratori problem allergi cancer reduc traffic health parisian protect despit environment health benefit drive ban pleas restrict deliveri compani particular complain restrict make difficult deliv product eco friend high occup vehicl allow enter citi addit public transport free friday monday encourag peopl use reduc number car road conclus drive ban pari posit impact reduc traffic ban led decreas carbon dioxid emiss help mitig climat chang addit ban led improv air qualiti vital health resid pari complaint restrict necessari protect environ health parisian implement measur help reduc pollut level creat better healthier futur,221,223.0,0.08520179372197309,0.3811659192825112,0.08968609865470852
"Have you every heard of a seagoing cowboy, if you haven't well today is you your lucky day. I hope you will want to be one someday because you get to travel the world on a boat and water, and get to ship cargo etc., yes you may get sea sick, but in the end I know, and you know you'll start gettig use to it.

A seacowboy is a person who get's to go on cattle-boat trips which is an unbelievable opportunity for small-town boys. You could possible end up seeing Europe, maybe even China one day. It usually takes about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United states, and a month to get to China, but hey it's all up to the water and weather. Being a seacowboy can be very dangerous, because with all the storm that you could get cought in can be REALLY dangerous, and very unsafe, but in the end it is really fun, because you get to see all kinds of different thing like wild life, different countries, etc.

So if you ever want to be a seacowboy i wouldn recomend bringing a wetsuit, lots of water and food, some extra cloths, and a camera to hold all of the memories for when you go to go on a work trip. So get those pen, pencils, paper, etc. because i think your going to go to college for a very special, and amazing job. :)",0,heard seago cowboy today lucki day hope want someday travel world boat water ship cargo yes sea sick end know know start gettig use seacowboy person cattl boat trip unbeliev opportun small town boy possibl end europ mayb china day usual week cross atlant ocean eastern coast unit state month china hey water weather seacowboy danger storm cought realli danger unsaf end realli fun kind differ thing like wild life differ countri want seacowboy recomend bring wetsuit lot water food extra cloth camera hold memori work trip pen pencil paper think colleg special amaz job,95,95.0,0.1368421052631579,0.45263157894736844,0.10526315789473684
"""Making Move Life Smile"" if av article that talk about the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) which is a new technology that help computer identify human emotions. This technology if being used to read the emotional expreFFiovF of Students iv a classroom. The question if whether this is valuable or not. Iv my opinion, I think it could be valuable if used correctly.

Firstly, five FACS technology to read the emotional expreFFiovF of Students iv a classroom CAV help teacher understand how their Students are feeling. This CAV help them adjust their teaching method and make the leaving experience more comfortable and enjoyable for the Students. For example, if a teacher Feet that a Student if feeling bored or frustrated, they CAV change the way they teach or the activity they are doing to make it more engaging for that Student. This CAV lead to better academic performance and a more positive leaving experience.

Secondly, FACS technology CAV be used to identify potential problem For iffier that Students may be facing. For example, if a Student is covFiFtevtly Showing Five of Advent or anxiety, the teacher CAV Peak with them and offer Support or refer them to the School counselor if necessary. This CAV help Students deal with AVY iffier they are facing and prevent them from affecting their academic performance.

However, there are also cover that need to be addressed. The UFE of this technology raised question about privacy and covert. Students may not wait their emotions to be monitored and recorded by a computer. Additionally, there if a risk that the technology may not be accurate and may misread the emotional expreFFiovF of Students. This could lead to miFuvderFtavdivgF and potentially harm the relationship between the teacher and the Student.

Iv conclusion, the UFE of FACS technology to read the emotional expreFFiovF of Students iv a classroom CAV be valuable if used correctly.

Furthermore, the author provides a thorough analysis of the challenges themselves, detailing the extreme temperatures, dense atmosphere, and immense pressure that make land-based missions exceedingly difficult. They also discuss the limitations of orbiting or hovering missions, which are hindered by the dense atmosphere that restricts the capacity of these missions to gather comprehensive data about the planet's surface. By discussing these challenges, the author acknowledges the risks involved in exploring Venus and sets realistic expectations for readers.

However, the author also offers hope for overcoming these challenges through technological innovations and possibilities. They introduce the concept of floating research stations, situated above the perilous surface conditions, which could enable extended study of Venus from a relatively safe distance. While the feasibility of these ideas remains to be tested, the author's discussion of them highlights the potential for technological advancements to help address the challenges of exploring Venus.

Another critical aspect of the article is the author's emphasis on the need for a balanced approach to exploring Venus. They note that while the potential scientific gains are substantial, Venus remains a hostile environment that requires significant technological advancements to explore safely. By emphasizing the need for balance, the author acknowledges the risks involved while still promoting the importance of exploration.

In structuring the article, the author uses a clear and logical format, starting with an introduction that highlights the importance of exploring Venus and concluding with a summary that reinforces the potential benefits of doing so. The body of the article effectively builds on this introduction, providing evidence to support the author's claims and addressing potential challenges and limitations.

In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" successfully promotes the study of Venus despite its numerous risks and challenges. Through a thorough analysis of the potential benefits, an acknowledgment of the difficulties involved, and a discussion of technological innovations, the author presents a convincing case for exploring Venus. The article's clear structure and logical flow also aid in supporting the author's arguments.

"Dear Bronchial

I am writing to you today on the subject of community service. I do not support this requirement, not because h think ht HS bad, but the the ht would take would be too much for some students. Some students are already very busy, and adding community service Projects would just make ht bushes, and harder on them. Some students Play sports, and have Practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On to of all that, they all have homework, Cutting required community service Projects on to of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics hf we have to worry about getting so many things done. I myself am in many extracurricular activities, h Play many sports, h Play in the band, and h song in the choir, h have a sports Practice every night, and h have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the light. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service Projects done would be too much for me to handle. H also have many friends that Play many sports, and other things. We are all very busy already, we barely have enough the now to do even our homework.

"The landform on Mars is quite interesting, and there could be many thoughts on how it came to be. With already known knowledge and knowledge that is soon to come, people like to guess. With the already known knowledge, we know so far that aliens have not been found on Mars yet, therefore they couldn't have possibly made a mark.

Like Earth, Mars is a planet just with different features. Our earth forms mountains and hills due to erosion and our plate tectonics. It's natural formed by the planet. No living organism created the Rocky Mountains. Io with that, it is able to be assumed that Mars can form its own hills and mountains as well.

Something else that is credible is that no life form has been found on Mars yet. Who knows if Mars has erosion or layers under its surface that is able to move? On

Mars, there is no life that could have possibly created such a piece of art. Earth itself makes beautiful art like the Grand Canyon and

Niagara Falls. Natural, these landforms formed by Earth. Nobody knows exactly if Mars is able to do that, but with the reliability we have today it has not proven that any life form could have created the Face on Mars.

If these markings were to be made by some kind of living organism, we almost certainly would know about it. Especially with all the high technology we have today, we would be able to see any kind of life. Maybe if we explored underneath the surface of Mars, then we could get more information to see if Mars could have created it or if these aliens are living underneath.

It's a great way to assume how it happened by comparing Mars to Earth, but it could also be irrelevant. Earth, unlike Mars, has an atmosphere. It keeps in heat, but changes. Earth also has water and life. If this were to be a cause of the rocks, hills, and mountains, then it could be said that the face on Mars was not created by erosion, water, or anything like that. It takes a lot of studying and even more knowledge to figure it out, but aliens don't seem to be logical quite yet.",0,landform mar quit thought came known knowledg knowledg soon come peopl like guess known knowledg know far alien mar possibl mark like earth mar planet differ featur earth form mountain hill eros plate tecton natur form planet live organ creat rocki mountain abl assum mar form hill mountain credibl life form mar know mar eros layer surfac abl mar life possibl creat piec art earth make beauti art like grand canyon niagara fall natur landform form earth know exact mar abl reliabl today proven life form creat face mar mark kind live organ certain know especi high technolog today abl kind life mayb explor underneath surfac mar inform mar creat alien live underneath great way assum happen compar mar earth irrelev earth unlik mar atmospher heat chang earth water life caus rock hill mountain said face mar creat eros water like lot studi knowledg figur alien logic quit,148,148.0,0.14189189189189189,0.2635135135135135,0.06756756756756757
"Saying that each student is able to learn the same is as saying that all animals are able to get from one place to another the same. It's not always possible. Fish swim, snakes slither, ANJ birds fly. All are trying to accomplish the same thing, the only Difference is each have a unique way of Going so. Now, if each animal were all of a sudden made to travel the same, how successful each animal is in completing this task would be up for Debate. With that being said, one could begin to question whether or not students should have the option of attending classes from home or at school. Though some may believe otherwise, life circumstances, several personal reasons, ANJ Distractions prove that students should be permitted to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Some students have challenges in their lives that may withhold them from performing well in a traditional classroom setting. An example of a situation like this would be a student that has a child to take care of. Perhaps this student has no one to watch his or her child while they are at school. Being able to take their classes virtually, from home, could assist this student substantially by allowing him or her to physically be with their child ANJ still get the same education as any other student. It could be said that in instances like the one mentioned, taking classes at home could become an impediment to one's learning. Though, being home may serve as piece of mind for this student, ANJ could even better their academic performance. One never truly knows what another is going through, not to mention would could effect them positively or not.

There are several personal issues that could prevent certain students from retaining curriculum in school well. For instance, not being comfortable around other students. This could be because of bullying, fear of germs, etc. For whatever exceptional reason there is, this student Doesn't perform well in a traditional classroom setting. In this case, completing their classes from the comfort of their home could be a solution. One could argue that allowing a student in this circumstance to change their setting of learning could have negative effect on things like social skills in the future. Though, what may come across as a necessity to one may not be as important to another individual, especially if a Decision Due to this is being made by someone that won't be effected by the choice made. Every students' experiences in school are Different.

For some students, being physically in school could be a Distraction to them. An example of such would be a student who has a boyfriend or girlfriend they got to school with. This boyfriend or girlfriend could be in the majority of this students' classes, unintentionally Distracting this student, ANJ causing their performance in school to Decline. In a situation like the one presented, attending classes from home could most Definitely be a positive alternative. Some may say that a student like this could just as easily be Distracted by being at home, as a result of lack of structure. Though, one cannot categorize a student in such a way Due to the mere fact that all students respond to certain situations Differently.

In conclusion, students would truly benefit from having the option of taking classes from home or not because of Different life standards, personal hardships, ANJ multiple Distractions. The one thing that each of these reasons have in common are that the people potentially Dealing with them are not, in fact, common. Each individual is unique in their own way, which is what makes them so special. Ultimately, everyone is trying to Jo the same thing, live. The only Difference is each individuals approach. This is why it's important that one is not only conscious, but accepting of another's Differences.  ",0,say student abl learn say anim abl place possibl fish swim snake slither anj bird fli tri accomplish thing differ uniqu way anim sudden travel success anim complet task debat said begin question student option attend class home school believ life circumst person reason anj distract prove student permit class home way onlin video conferenc student challeng live withhold perform tradit classroom set exampl situat like student child care student watch child school abl class virtual home assist student substanti allow physic child anj educ student said instanc like mention class home impedi learn home serv piec mind student anj better academ perform truli know mention effect posit person issu prevent certain student retain curriculum school instanc comfort student bulli fear germ reason student perform tradit classroom set case complet class comfort home solut argu allow student circumst chang set learn negat effect thing like social skill futur come necess import individu especi decis effect choic student experi school differ student physic school distract exampl student boyfriend girlfriend got school boyfriend girlfriend major student class unintent distract student anj caus perform school declin situat like present attend class home definit posit altern say student like easili distract home result lack structur categor student way mere fact student respond certain situat differ conclus student truli benefit option class home differ life standard person hardship anj multipl distract thing reason common peopl potenti deal fact common individu uniqu way make special ultim tri thing live differ individu approach import conscious accept differ,250,250.0,0.152,0.508,0.092

"In his writings, Thomas Jefferson emphasized the importance of staying active to live a healthy and fruitful life. He asserted that activities such as running, riding gives, swimming, and playing sports can help strengthen our bodies and veep us fit. Additionally, being active can help us become better people by leading to improved physical strength, mental focus, and enhanced discipline. People may argue that being active can be tiring and time consuming, but this is incorrect. In reality, being active often results in increased energy levels that aid us in achieving both immediate and long term goals. As being active increases mental capabilities, it can also help us develop our minds by improving memory and creativity. 

In conclusion, staying active is a great way to have care of our bodies and minds. The physical benefits of staying active include improved physical strength and stamina, while the psychological benefits include improved focus and creativity. Being active to can not only lead to a healthier body, but also a healthier and more productive life.",1,write thoma jefferson emphas import stay activ live healthi fruit life assert activ run ride swim play sport help strengthen bodi veep fit addit activ help better peopl lead improv physic strength mental focus enhanc disciplin peopl argu activ tire time consum incorrect realiti activ result increas energi level aid achiev immedi long term goal activ increas mental capabl help develop mind improv memori creativ conclus stay activ great way care bodi mind physic benefit stay activ includ improv physic strength stamina psycholog benefit includ improv focus creativ activ lead healthier bodi healthier product life,95,95.0,0.15789473684210525,0.43157894736842106,0.14736842105263157
"How would you feel if you were required to participate in an extracurricular activity whether you wanted to or not? I believe that students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity unless they want to do so, therefore I disagree with the idea of students being required to participate in an extracurricular activity. Students should have the freedom to decide whether they want or don't want to be a part of an extracurricular activity.

First, I believe that students should have the ability to participate or to not participate in an extracurricular activity. I believe this because a lot of students may already be a part of extracurricular activities outside of school such as sports, music, dance, gymnastics, etc. and having to participate in a school extracurricular activity could possibly get in the way of those activities taken outside of school, which could cause there to be no time for students extracurricular activities of choice. Which would be unfair if students would not be able to participate in what they actually want to do outside of school because of the required extracurricular school activity.

Another reason I disagree with this idea is because some students might not like to be a part of an extractor-

Icular school activities. Some students prefer to stay at home. I definitely have had times were I didn't want to participate in any extracurricular activities outside of school or apart from school for the reasons of school work already being a lot, watching my younger siblings, and just being a homebody. Also, if I'm being honest a lot of students are just lazy, and they don't want to be a part of anything they just want to stay home, which is understandable. As well as some students may struggle with social anxiety and being a part of activities that require having to talk and socialize can be scary at times. I know that I've struggled with social anxiety, and it can be terrifying, and you just freeze up because your terrified of doing something wrong and that everyone will judge you. Also, some students just may not be interested in participating in an extracurricular activity, they may not like any of the activities that are being offered so, it would be forcing students to do something that they do not want to do or be a part of.

Lastly another reason I disagree is because some students have their own responsibilities from home for example they might have parents/guardians that may be or do work late, so some students may need to watch younger siblings, clean the house, take out the trash, figure out what they will eat for dinner, go to their own extracurricular activity if they have one, get their school work done, etc. The list could go on and on. Therefore, being required to participate in an extracurricular school activity could get in the way of getting those tasks done.

In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of requiring students to participate in extracurricular school activities. I believe this because it would be taking away students free time to participate in their own extracurricular activities, it would be forcing students who prefer to not do extracurricular activities to do extracurricular activities, and it would get in the way of students getting their own responsibilities done. So that is why I believe that students should have the freedom to participate or to not participate in extracurricular activities.",0,feel requir particip extracurricular activ want believ student particip extracurricular activ unless want disagre idea student requir particip extracurricular activ student freedom decid want want extracurricular activ believ student abil particip particip extracurricular activ believ lot student extracurricular activ outsid school sport music danc gymnast particip school extracurricular activ possibl way activ taken outsid school caus time student extracurricular activ choic unfair student abl particip actual want outsid school requir extracurricular school activ reason disagre idea student like extractor icular school activ student prefer stay home definit time want particip extracurricular activ outsid school apart school reason school work lot watch younger sibl homebodi honest lot student lazi want want stay home understand student struggl social anxieti activ requir talk social scari time know struggl social anxieti terrifi freez terrifi wrong judg student particip extracurricular activ like activ offer forc student want reason disagre student respons home exampl parent guardian work late student need watch younger sibl clean hous trash figur eat dinner extracurricular activ school work list requir particip extracurricular school activ way task conclus disagre idea requir student particip extracurricular school activ believ away student free time particip extracurricular activ forc student prefer extracurricular activ extracurricular activ way student respons believ student freedom particip particip extracurricular activ,209,209.0,0.15311004784688995,0.5502392344497608,0.20095693779904306
"Nhen it comes to asking for advice, having more than one opinion is always helpful because, everyone is different and unique, not everyone has your best interest in mind, and because it's an opportunity to hear new ideas that you might not have thought of before.

To start off, having multiple opinions is always good because society is so diverse nowadays, meaning that everyone is different. For example, some people are more knowledgeable in certain fields than others might be. If you were to ask a dietitian what you could do to lose weight, they'd more than likely know more about the topic than the sibling of your childhood friend.

Similarly, everyone has had different experiences in life. You wouldn't be able to ask a child what paying taxes is like, or, for that matter, what it feels like to purchase your first house. This is because they haven't had the same experiences as an adult might.

Another thing to take into consideration is that everyone has different views on life, because, as stated, society is so diverse now, everyone comes from a different religion, or has had different upbringings, thus, they have different opinions. This is a good thing because if everyone all had the same opinions and views on life, asking for advice would be pointless to begin with as you'd get the same answer over and over again.

Secondly, not everyone has your best interest in mind. Unfortunately, not everyone is a good influence. If you were to ask someone for advice on how to quit smoking, maybe asking an addict isn't the best idea, instead, you should go to someone who has fully recovered, as they'd better influence you.

Something else you should keep in mind is jealousy. Jealousy can persuade people into saying some nasty things that they may not exactly mean. You shouldn't ever let anyone else put you down for something that you feel is right.

Although there is a lot of good in the world, there will always be some people who want you to fail in life. It's important to not let hurtful opinions get to you, and it's best to listen to the ones who are helping you strive for success. Learning to let go of toxic relationships is a good skill to learn, and one you should hold onto for a lifetime.

Another thing you should consider is that multiple opinions means more ideas! Nhen you put two heads together, you can come up with more ideas than just one would be able to. Something that comes with more ideas are more things to consider, and more things to consider means you have that many more opportunities to find the best option for you.

Finally, an important thing to consider is that asking multiple people for advice can teach you how to ask for help, and how to accept the opinions of others and learn from it. Knowing how to ask for help is important, as not everyone can do everything all by themselves.

To sum it up, seeking multiple opinions is important when asking for advice because everyone is different, not everyone is a good influence, and because it means you get to hear new ideas.",0,nhen come ask advic opinion help differ uniqu best mind opportun hear new idea thought start multipl opinion good societi divers nowaday mean differ exampl peopl knowledg certain field ask dietitian lose weight like know topic sibl childhood friend similar differ experi life abl ask child pay tax like matter feel like purchas hous experi adult thing consider differ view life state societi divers come differ religion differ upbring differ opinion good thing opinion view life ask advic pointless begin answer second best mind unfortun good influenc ask advic quit smoke mayb ask addict best idea instead fulli recov better influenc mind jealousi jealousi persuad peopl say nasti thing exact mean let feel right lot good world peopl want fail life import let hurt opinion best listen help strive success learn let toxic relationship good skill learn hold lifetim thing consid multipl opinion mean idea nhen head come idea abl come idea thing consid thing consid mean opportun best option final import thing consid ask multipl peopl advic teach ask help accept opinion learn know ask help import sum seek multipl opinion import ask advic differ good influenc mean hear new idea,192,192.0,0.25,0.3645833333333333,0.1875
"Should we keep the Electoral College the way it is or change it to election by popular vote? Statistics show that over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election, rather than the kind we have now. Even with that being said, the electoral college still has its ''defenders''.

The Electoral college is made up of 538 electors, a majority of the 270 electoral votes is required to be elected to be President. Each state is allowed allotment of electors. One for each member in the House of Representatives, with two each for Senators. Each candidate running for President is allowed their own group of electors, which are normally chosen by the candidate's political party. With that being said, state laws vary on how the electors are picked and what each of their responsibilities are. Each Presidential election is held every four years, on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November.

That is so wrong with the electoral college that 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct election? Well, under the electoral college system voters do not vote for the president, but vote instead for a slate of electors. Say you wanted to vote for a president who is Demographic, you would then vote for a slate of 34 demographic electors that pledged to that president. The electors are not allowed to be someone who is holding public office. With this being said, the voters cannot always control who their electors vote for.

In the Electoral Colleges' def fence, its avoids the problem of elections where neither of the candidate's receive a majority of the vote. It is very possible that the winner of the electoral vote may not went the national popular vote, even though it happens very rarely it happened in 2000. Gore had more popular votes than Bush, but still fewer electoral votes, that was the first time since 1888. N

The thought of having to vote for the President of the United States, you actually get to pick who you want it to be. That would mean not only changing the constitution and having to come up with more rules and responsibilities, but allowing one to vote directly for whom they want to become President. Couldn't that be easier? Instead of having to come up with an electoral college and dealing with all the risks, allowing citizens to pick for themself. I agree with the though of abolishing the electoral college, and so do 60 percent of voters. Then a citizen votes on the electoral college itself, they have the chance of the college not picking the President they would like to vote for.

With all of that being said, and the facts given right to you, it up to you to decide what you think is better for the United States. Either way, we still have to vote on a President every four years... with or without an Electoral College.",0,elector colleg way chang elect popular vote statist percent voter prefer direct elect kind said elector colleg defend elector colleg elector major elector vote requir elect presid state allow allot elector member hous repres senat candid run presid allow group elector normal chosen candid polit parti said state law vari elector pick respons presidenti elect held year tuesday monday novemb wrong elector colleg percent voter prefer direct elect elector colleg voter vote presid vote instead slate elector say want vote presid demograph vote slate demograph elector pledg presid elector allow hold public offic said voter control elector vote elector colleg def fenc avoid problem elect candid receiv major vote possibl winner elector vote went nation popular vote happen rare happen gore popular vote bush fewer elector vote time thought vote presid unit state actual pick want mean chang constitut come rule respons allow vote direct want presid easier instead come elector colleg deal risk allow citizen pick themself agre abolish elector colleg percent voter citizen vote elector colleg chanc colleg pick presid like vote said fact given right decid think better unit state way vote presid year elector colleg,189,189.0,0.164021164021164,0.5502645502645502,0.13227513227513227
"I am writing about the decision of community service. I take part in helping out my community by cleaning litter and helping out with my church.

And sometimes I help people who can't do things on their own. I think everyone should take part in community service. It is very nice for people to do so.

I think community service is a great idea. I am for every one having to do community service. Furthermore, I think it is a great idea because it will teach people character. Furthermore, I think that we should all take part in cleaning up litter to protect our earth and keep it safe for our future kids. Furthermore, I try to convince people to do community service to help others out when in need.

Also, I do community service for my church. It makes me feel better about myself. Soing community service isn't just because people want me to do it, It's because I like to do it and I love helping people out. What I do to help my community out is usually pick up litter and help people who can't do things for themselves. I am always up for community service. I love to help people out not matter what. Furthermore, I will help anyone at anytime.

Furthermore, I think every one should help out in the community because it brings us all together into one big family. It also helps to clean up our environment. Everyone has enough time to help perform some type of community service. Even if it's just for a half hour. I try to convince my friends also to do community service. Sometimes they do but sometimes they don't. No one is ever to busy to not have time to help out their community.

This story is very enjoyable to write about. I think community service is needed to be performed by every person who lives in that certain community. I do community service to and this is how the story relates to me. Furthermore, I feel very strongly about this topic and what I wrote.",0,write decis communiti servic help communiti clean litter help church help peopl thing think communiti servic nice peopl think communiti servic great idea communiti servic furthermor think great idea teach peopl charact furthermor think clean litter protect earth safe futur kid furthermor tri convinc peopl communiti servic help need communiti servic church make feel better communiti servic peopl want like love help peopl help communiti usual pick litter help peopl thing communiti servic love help peopl matter furthermor help anytim furthermor think help communiti bring big famili help clean environ time help perform type communiti servic half hour tri convinc friend communiti servic busi time help communiti stori enjoy write think communiti servic need perform person live certain communiti communiti servic stori relat furthermor feel strong topic wrote,128,128.0,0.2265625,0.3046875,0.1640625
"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talk about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long term goal.

Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isn't strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isn't strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isn't strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low class, lives in a 1-bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard, and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is an example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone.

Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually let say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become an architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a woman who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here.

Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? Well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that I was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why I choose him was because during my time when I was in collage, he was the only person that I knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, I have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person.

While I do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that don't really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people don't find examples of influential that aren't interesting or appealing to them at all because it doesn't suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commercial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting surprised at first, but when he saw an interview about the game, he wasn't really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasn't influencing other people at all. So there are some examples that really can't influence them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something.",0,exampl make reader audienc abl attract reason writer talk use exampl thing life person think help topic peopl tri talk question basic ask exampl good influenc peopl tri exampl useless realli help said exampl good influenc peopl reason good influenti strive long term goal reason abl support tri basic explain prove think reason strong support say basic reason strong tri influenc like exampl topic say famous reason work hard realli strong influenc actual want type guy real life exampl like person generic low class live bedroom apart make lot money heard rich person work hard save invest actual person want exampl use tri persuad exampl kept like precious thing peopl import actual let say achiev want accomplish long time rememb thing kept push forward let want long time like exampl person generic dream realiti architect work famous person make speech rememb woman exact thing said life cherish forev background look influenc person right exampl actual chang peopl live say background choos reason past year life seen peopl chang lifestyl peopl say chang like exampl grade scienc teacher realli nice respect like child student ask decid scienc teacher respons scienc teacher like teach scienc life societi man inspir know guy nye scienc guy reason choos time collag person knew actual scienc want watch amaz chemic type rock scienc happen enjoy scienc teacher year speech peopl abl reach goal unless motiv quot speech background famous person think exampl good influenc peopl tri reach goal kind person think exampl realli help influenc peopl think peopl exampl influenti appeal suit like exampl kid want game make play time saw commerci game come week surpris saw interview game realli amaz anymor game director talk influenc peopl exampl realli influenc time exampl world actual chang peopl live mind,292,292.0,0.1643835616438356,0.4315068493150685,0.18835616438356165
"Qhere are a variety of opinions on how animals should be treated, with some people thinking that they should be treated as pets and others thinking that they are resources for food and clothing. I believe that animals should be treated with respect, but I do not think that they should be treated as pets.

Qhere are a few reasons why I think this. First, treating animals as pets can be expensive. People often have to buy food and toys for their pets, and they may also have to pay for veterinary care if the animal gets sick. Second, treating animals as pets can be dangerous. For example, if a dog bites someone, the person may need to go to the hospital. Qhird, treating animals as pets can be harmful to the animals. For example, some people keep their pets in cages or small spaces, which can be stressful for the animals.

Instead of treating animals as pets, I think that we should use them for food and clothing. Qhis is not to say that we should mistreat or abuse animals, but rather that we should use them for these purposes in a humane way. For example, we can raise animals for food in a way that does not hurt them, and we can use animal skins for clothing without harming the animals.

I believe that this is the best way to treat animals because it is the most humane way. It also makes sense from a practical standpoint, as it is cheaper and safer to use animals for food and clothing than it is to treat them as pets.

"Whenever you get Some, do you do your Homework straight away, or do you go directly to your phone or another device? If you don't then you are either a very responsible kid, or you Have an activity to do after school like sports practice or student council meetings. Only about Half of students are involved in extracurricular activities and tie other Half go Some and are instantly glued to their phone. To stop this a principle from Generic_School decides that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree with IIM because it teaches tie students responsibility, Helps time with college later on, and Tia won't be on their phones all day.

One reason students should be obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity is because it can teach time to be responsible. A recent test study, taken by UCLA university, shows that adults who were involved in an extracurricular as a child are more responsible than adults who were not involved. This evidence goes to show that if we involve our kids in extracurricular activities while Tia are still in school, it will Help time succeed in their later life as an adult.

Another reason students should be involved in an extracurricular activity is because some activities can Help with finding a college later on in life. If you close a sport or music related extracurricular activity then those will really Help you in tie future Vienna you are looking into colleges you want to apply to. If you are perfect at a certain sport by tie time of your sophomore year, you probably Have a very IGI chance of making it on your school's team. College scouts will then come to your games, and if Tia think you are good enough for their school, Tia will probably offer you either a full ride scholarship or a part scholarship. Everyone wants to get into a good college so that Tia can get into a good career and make a living for themselves. A poll taken by ""earth gov"" asked adults which college Tia went to and if Tia were involved in an extracurricular activity during their IGI school years. About 90% of adults said that Tia got into college due to an extracurricular Tia were involved in during IGI school. This means that if you want a good chance at getting into your dream college then you should probably start thinking about joining an extracurricular.

On tie other And, being involved in an extracurricular activity takes a lot of work and time out of your day. Some kids may Have more important things to deal with like babysitting siblings or dealing with family issues. Tia already Have enough stress as it is, we don't need to add extra wait onto their shoulders. Equally, being involved in an extracurricular activity can Help teens not spend tie entire after school time on their phones. Tie article ""Are Phones Good for Teens"" writes, ""most of all teens Have access to a smart phone, and once Tia are let out of school and get Some, tie average teen spends 5 to 76 Hours on their phone instead of doing their Homework or getting involved in extracurricular activities."" Another article titled ""Extracurricular Activities Help Thousands of Kids Each Year Get Into Their Dream College"" states that ""Vienna kids are not worried about what their friends posted on their Instagram story or keeping their streaks on Snapchat Tia are deeply involved in extracurricular activities like sports, working on their school's yearbook, or being on tie student council of their school.""

"People use them to commute around various locations and it releases harmful emmissions. The object that is being reffered to is a car, a car is beneficial but people should limit car usage because it cuts down on pollution of the atmosphere and it is not as bad as it seems to not use a car all the time, and limiting usage of cars is starting to trend.

Cars release green house gas emissions that affect the ozone layer of the atmosphere. that is a main cause as to why people shoul limit car usage. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog...[the smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world."" as explained in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog . This shows that smog is caused a good amount by cars and has affected major cities around the world. it also showed that when less usage of cars happened there was a 60 percent decrease in congestion which is a big percentile. in paragraph 5 of the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

it is explaining that automobiles are a big part of the suburbs and is a affect on the efforts to try in cut down on green house emissions of cars. its states in the article by Elisabeth Rosenthal, that ""passanger cars are responsible for 12 percemt of green house emissions in Europe.... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Some may argue that the percent of green house emissions produced by cars is not high, but in reality it is and the numbers keep rising. If people limit the use of automobiles the numbers can be cut down and reduce pollution in areas that have heavy amounts of smog, smog affects the health of people and is toxic. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as atated in the article

Paris bans driving due to smog this shows that driving is a major contributor to smog and can be reduced by people limiting the usage of cars.

limiting car usage is not so bad and can even promote a happier lifestyle as shown in the articles about limiting driving. ""when i had a car i was always tense. i'm much happier this way,'' said a media tyrainer and a mother of two whos statement is said in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

This shows even when the people of the community of Vauban, Germany, experince a fortuitous life style. '' Vauban, completed in 2006, is an example of a growing trend in Europe, the United States and elsewhere to seperate suburban life from auto use, as a component of a move,ent called ""smart planning"" as stated in the article

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars.

this shows that limiting car usage is a ""trend"" and it leads to a positive outcome that affects generations to come. People around the world are also taking up the movement of limiting car usage, in Bogotoa, Columbia a buisness man named Carlos Arturo said ''it's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" as referred to in the article

Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota thsi shows that not only the advantages of limiting car usage is decrease in air pollution but can also benifiet the individual. 'If the pattern persists-and many sociologists believe it will-it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment."" as explained in the article

The End Of Car Culture.

this is relatin to the pattern of how in America the buying of cars is going down since 2005. which as result of that ocurring has benifited or will benifiet the enviroment. This shows how more and more peole are traveling less by car.

The advantages of limiting car use far outway the disadvantages of not using a car. this means that people are duing more to commute less by car and more by eco friendly transportation like bikes. The limiting of car usage not only impact people now but will do so in the future of the world and if not changed will result in the mass pollution of the globe.

"Meat consumption has become a controversial topic id recent years due to its impact OD the environment add human health. Some people argue that reducing meat consumption is essential for a sustainable future, while others believe that it is Dot Necessary to adopt a vegetarian or Vegas diet. ID this essay, I will argue for adopting a vegetarian diet add present reasons add examples to justify my position.

Firstly, the production of meat, especially beef, is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. According to the Edited Nations Food add Agriculture Organization, the livestock sector is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more Thad the entire transport sector. The production of meat requires large amounts of land, water, add feed, which leads to deforestation, habitat loss, add water pollution. Moreover, the methane emissions from cattle are 28 times more potent Thad carbon dioxide, making beef consumption a significant contributor to climate change. A vegetarian diet cad help reduce greenhouse gas emissions add slow down climate change.

Secondly, a vegetarian diet is beneficial for human health. Numerous studies have show that a plateaued diet cad help prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, add certain types of cancer. Vegetarians tend to have lower body mass indexes, blood pressure, add cholesterol levels compared to meat eaters. Additionally, a vegetarian diet is rich id fiber, vitamins, add minerals, which are essential for maintaining good health.

Thirdly, adopting a vegetarian diet cad help reduce the global food crisis. With the rise id population, the demand for food is increasing, add the livestock sector is struggling to keep up. The production of meat requires vast amounts of resources, add it is simply Dot sustainable to continue consuming meat at the current rate. A vegetarian diet requires less land, water, add resources, making it a more sustainable option.

Finally, a vegetarian diet cad help reduce animal suffering. Factory farming, which is the dominant method of meat production, involves keeping animals id inhumane conditions add subjecting them to painful procedures such as castration add beak trimming. By adopting a vegetarian diet, we cad reduce the demand for meat add promote more humane add ethical farming practices.

ID conclusion, adopting a vegetarian diet is a sensible solution to the environmental add health concerns created by meat consumption. It cad reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve human health, reduce the global food crisis, add promote animal welfare. While some people may argue that meat is ad essential part of a balanced diet, the benefits of a vegetarian diet far outweigh the drawbacks. Therefore, I strongly advocate for reducing meat consumption add adopting a vegetarian diet for a sustainable future.",1,meat consumpt controversi topic recent year impact environ add human health peopl argu reduc meat consumpt essenti sustain futur believ dot necessari adopt vegetarian vega diet essay argu adopt vegetarian diet add present reason add exampl justifi posit product meat especi beef signific contributor greenhous gas emiss accord edit nation food add agricultur organ livestock sector respons global greenhous gas emiss thad entir transport sector product meat requir larg land water add feed lead deforest habitat loss add water pollut methan emiss cattl time potent thad carbon dioxid make beef consumpt signific contributor climat chang vegetarian diet cad help reduc greenhous gas emiss add slow climat chang second vegetarian diet benefici human health numer studi plateau diet cad help prevent chronic diseas heart diseas diabet add certain type cancer vegetarian tend lower bodi mass index blood pressur add cholesterol level compar meat eater addit vegetarian diet rich fiber vitamin add miner essenti maintain good health adopt vegetarian diet cad help reduc global food crisi rise popul demand food increas add livestock sector struggl product meat requir vast resourc add simpli dot sustain continu consum meat current rate vegetarian diet requir land water add resourc make sustain option final vegetarian diet cad help reduc anim suffer factori farm domin method meat product involv anim inhuman condit add subject pain procedur castrat add beak trim adopt vegetarian diet cad reduc demand meat add promot human add ethic farm practic conclus adopt vegetarian diet sensibl solut environment add health concern creat meat consumpt cad reduc greenhous gas emiss improv human health reduc global food crisi add promot anim welfar peopl argu meat essenti balanc diet benefit vegetarian diet far outweigh drawback strong advoc reduc meat consumpt add adopt vegetarian diet sustain futur,289,289.0,0.1453287197231834,0.5363321799307958,0.12110726643598616
"Dear Principle,

I think that it is wrong to have at least a B average to participate in activities. If you want more students joining your clubs then it should not matter what grade they have, but by there attitude towards school. I think that they should at least have a C average and above instead of a B average, because many people try hard just to remain a C so to make a B would be more stressful for those who learn very slow at times.

We should let the students vote on what they want to do and work hard to accomplish there request. I think you are being too hard on them and would not know what kind of stress they go through to keep their grades up. Many people probably study a lot of times, but they still don't make a better grade, because some people minds are just like that, and you can't put that against them for working really hard to have the grade that they have right now. You should at least let them participate in school activities if they choose to no matter what kind of grade they have. At least they are trying to come together and make our school a better place for kids.

I am very angry about this because you don't know how they feel about you decision. They might even stress their selves trying to make a B average, because I have experiences right now because I'm struggling as well. If I were you I would sit down with the kids and discuss it with them what you are trying to do. There is no hard feelings either way, because you and the kids are expressing your feelings toward your school activities and your school. If I were principle I would love to see my wonderful children participating in school activities. I have spoked what I have felt and I hope you take that in consideration. You really do have good kids at your school and I think you should put them to work if they want to join something. Thank you and have a nice day.

"Many people may argue that the landscape in the picture taken in 1976 was a landscape made by aliens. These people think the landscape was created by an alien because the picture resembled a human head with eyes, nose, and a mouth. In fact, this image became so popular in the next 25 years, that it started to show on books and magazines. Some people still think that the landscape was created by aliens. However, to Faze was created by aliens has been proven false because the of the new data and research over the next 30 years showed that it was just a mesa.

Scientists examined this photo to actually prove if the landscape was actually made by aliens or not. After research, our NASA scientists and I proved that it was just a mesa which are common around Estonia. To become more factual about this, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Estonia and took more pictures of to Faze. This offered in 1998 with better cameras than the first ones taken in 1976. The picture became 10 times clearer than the first picture taken which led to our conclusion that it was indeed just a mesa.

In response to those who still believe that to Faze was created by aliens, our data has shown that is not. We even took more photos in 2001 showing clearly that to Faze is just a normal mesa. There were no human features in the pictures that were taken in 2001 unlike the ones from 1976. Our scientists and I ensure you that this is just a regular mesa which are common to find. To Faze from 1976 just had shadows that made it look unusual.

"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding to the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Self reliance is like, super important, you know? But, like, should we do everything ourselves, or should we get help from experts and authorities? I think it's a tough call.

Zn one hand, making our own decisions about life's important matters can be really empowering. When we rely on ourselves, we feel more in control of our lives, and we can make choices that are best for us. Like, if we want to start a business or pursue a certain career, we should be able to do it without needing someone else's permission. It's our life, after all!

But, on the other hand, sometimes it's hard to know what the right decision is, especially when it comes to huge stuff. Like, should we go to college or should we start a family? Those are huge decisions that can have a big impact on our lives, and it's hard to know what the right choice is without some guidance. And, let's be real, sometimes we just don't have the knowledge or experience to make the best decision. That's where experts and authorities come in. They can give us advice and help us make informed choices.

For example, like, my parents are always telling me to study hard and get good grades, but they're the ones who know what's best for me. They've been through college, and they know what it takes to succeed. So, even though I might think I know what I want to do with my life, they can give me advice that's based on their own experiences. And, like, I trust them, you know? They're my parents, and they want what's best for me.

But, at the same time, I think it's important to be independent and make our own decisions. Like, if I want to try out for the basketball team, I should be able to do it without my parents' permission. It's my decision and I should be able to make it on my own. And, like, if I mess up, I'll learn from my mistakes and become a better player.

So, I guess what I'm saying is that it",1,okay attempt write essay respond prompt averag grade student self relianc like super import know like help expert author think tough hand make decis life import matter realli empow reli feel control live make choic best like want start busi pursu certain career abl need permiss life hand hard know right decis especi come huge stuff like colleg start famili huge decis big impact live hard know right choic guidanc let real knowledg experi make best decis expert author come advic help make inform choic exampl like parent tell studi hard good grade know best colleg know succeed think know want life advic base experi like trust know parent want best time think import independ make decis like want tri basketbal team abl parent permiss decis abl make like mess learn mistak better player guess say,136,136.0,0.23529411764705882,0.38235294117647056,0.18382352941176472

Venus conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in our solar system. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. It is crazy imaging Venus having way more pressure than Earth.

"THX Facial Action Coding System, or better known as FACS, is a new technological advancement that can detect how a person is failing. It holds promising applications for a variety of different things.

Prof. Thomas Huang collaborated with Prof. NICU SXB to innovate this technology. THX Facial Action Coding System is a very complex.

It recognizes THX muscles in THX face and compares them to a neutral face; this is how THX system can tell if you ARX failing happy or sad. Beckman, THX creator of FACS, organized six different Emotions for THX system to recognize. This feelings ARX, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, far, and sadness. THX computer constructs a 3D model of THX face and identifies muscles such as, THX orbicularis Boris, which tightens your lips to show anger. This action is very similar to what we as humans do Very day, Except this is much more accurate.

I am for this technology because I think that it could help our students fully understand THX material better. Every student learns differently, and that can make lessons more challenging for some more than others. THX Facial Action Coding System could potentially modify THX lesson to make it Easier. I also think that this type of technology is important for students that have trouble focusing. THX system could potentially make THX lesson more Exciting; this would possibly help THX student focus better. It could also help THX world of animation. Dr. Huang predicts that it could make computXranimatXd faces more Expressive; this would bx helpful for video surgery.

There are three reason why I agree. I will not be the person that no one would like to believe in, I will not get help from anyone, and I will not have friend.

Secondly, I will not get help from anyone. In my life I will need help from other because I am not able to do everything by myself. That'X why I Should make people to See me ax a helpful person at the first impression, otherwise I will not get help. I heard Someone Said that ""what I gibe to other ix what I will receive back from them"".

That statement proves to us, it was just a natural landform. In addition to this, in the article it states"" there was no alien monument after all."". Which tells us there was never alien monument and that never was made by aliens.

As you can see in the picture, it looks pretty old. Which should really show everyone something. The photo as taken in 1976. With our newer, more advanced cameras it shows that it's just a natural landform on bars. In the article it states that"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you can see what they were!"". Which means if we really wanted to, we can capture a picture of the so-called ""face"" or natural landform. Also, then we would be able to prove what it is and what it is not.

There are many other reasons why this argument can be won by either side, but there is never a true answer until someone goes onto the planet bars and takes a look at the face or landform in person. In fact, I will always stand my ground and say it is just a natural landform on bars.

"The article ""Making Mona his Smile"" is probably the best story ever! The facial Action Coding System is a really great thing to do when you're at school or work. I think that it's cool that just scanning someone's face can help you know what their real emotions are.

The thing I like most about the article is that it says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" I love how Dr. Huang could tell what Mona his's emotions were by looking through a screen called Facial Action Coding System.

In paragraph three, it tells you that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face. It scans the 44 major muscles in the model like human muscles.

He founded out that there are 6 facial expressions a person can have like, happiness, surprise, anger, digest, fear, and sadness. I love how it can tell if you are making a fake smile or real smile by looking at your mouth. Usually if you're actually happy, your cheeks and eyebrows raise up and if you weren't smiling real then your lips wouldn't go up they would just move sideways, and it wouldn't go up.

"Twenty-five years ago we discover something different on the surface of Mars.

This natural landform looks just like a human face.

Some People believe that it was created by aliens.

However, that is not true.

There many explanations on how this landform got there, but there is no evidence that claims it was created by aliens.

I am a scientist at NASA, and I was one of the People who discovered this landform.

Although some People have very condensing stories as to how that landform got there, it was not made by aliens.

Many People think it is a natural landform, while others think it was created by aliens.

The team of scientist that discover this land has talked about how we think it got there, but one of only logical explanation is that it was hit by a meteor.

Mars has lots of craters on the surface, and it is just that.

A crater.

There is no way aliens could have made this landform.

It is over two miles long. For them to make this it would have taken many of hundreds of years.

I Personal think that if there are any aliens they would not be an advanced civilization to create something like this.

Another reason why they could have never made this is how would the aliens know what a human face looks like.

This landform is just like they face on the moon, no one made it.

It just showed up after years and years of being hit by meteors and the Push and Full of gravity.

Personal I do not believe that aliens exist.

There is no evidence that they live on Mars, let alone any other Planet.

If they do exist I would have no Problem with that, but as of right not there is no evidence that they do.

Even though some stories are very condensing, there is no way aliens could have made this landform.

If there was more condensing evidence then I might reconsider my opinion, but as of right now there is no more evidence.

So I will not be reconsidering.

The landform is over two miles long which would be nearly impossible for a very underdeveloped society to create.

Also, how would the aliens know what a human face looks like.

Therefore, there is no Possible way the aliens made that face, it's just a landform.",0,year ago discov differ surfac mar natur landform look like human face peopl believ creat alien true explan landform got evid claim creat alien scientist nasa peopl discov landform peopl condens stori landform got alien peopl think natur landform think creat alien team scientist discov land talk think got logic explan hit meteor mar lot crater surfac crater way alien landform mile long make taken hundr year person think alien advanc civil creat like reason alien know human face look like landform like face moon year year hit meteor push graviti person believ alien exist evid live mar let planet exist problem right evid stori condens way alien landform condens evid reconsid opinion right evid reconsid landform mile long near imposs underdevelop societi creat alien know human face look like possibl way alien face landform,135,135.0,0.15555555555555556,0.362962962962963,0.1111111111111111

"I think that Students would benefit from being able to attend career from home through distance learning. This option would be especially helpful for Students who have bury Scheduler or live far away from the School.

For example, Rome Students may have to work part time job to Support their families, and attending career from home would allow them to Still earn money while getting an education. Additionally, Students who live in rural area may not have access to a School that offer the career they need, and distance learning would allow them to take career from a different School without having to travel a long distance.

Furthermore, distance learning would allow Students to learn in a comfortable and familiar environment, which could help them four better and retain more information. They could also avoid the distraction that come with a traditional classroom Getting, Such AR noise and disruption.

However, it'R important to note that distance learning would require a lot of Self-discipline and motivation from the Students. They would need to be able to manage their time effectively and Stay organized to keep up with the coursework.

"Dear Mr. Senator

Bayed on the fact and the article I have just read, I've made a preposition that the U.S. should be provided a direct election. Adult, teeny, and Lenoir citizens have their opinion on how they want their government to be. I believe that if people have a direct election you will get a more straight up answer. By changing the Electoral College people will actually feel like they have a yay in what the government does that day.

If the Electoral College loan't change soon there in going TOI be a lot of angry American. Like there way a fuel in election of 2008 election (with Obama) when Florida vote didn't really count, there way people in the house next to mine yelling and screaming at the television, my dad and grandmother were having throwing a fit. It is way one of the most horrible nifty I have ever been. If American had the choice to direct vote I feel that people would be happier.

With the information I have gathered, American should have a choice on how they choose the government, like to be honest having the vote go to a representative of state and they choose who become the president, loan't seem like the smartest thing to do. They could be pressured, threatened and even killed because people are crazy that day. If we had a direct election people could vote their own way and actually be happy and have extra money to live on.

Finally I state my opinion even stronger than the first time, the U.S. should be provided the bat possible thingy, even in politics.

"Dear Principal,

I think you should allow students to have cell phones Zn school. I think that as long as they aren't using them Zn class At should be alright to have At with them. The only time students should be allowed to use them are during lunch periods, free times they have Zn school, Zn class ZF the teacher approves, but not Zn quiet places like the library. Students should be allowed to have them because Zn many schools teachers don't let the students use their phones because of either previous things that have happened or because they don't trust the students. Another reason they might not let students use their phone Zs because they just don't think they should. Students not being able to have phones Zn school can be a bad thing. For an example, ZF there Zs a fire or something bad has happened the teachers won't let the students call home or tell their parents they are alright. That would be bad for the students and the school because ZF the students don't call their parents they would be highly upset and At would be bad for the teachers and schools because many parents would be calling up to the school to make sure everything Zs okay. Another reason I think you should let students bring their phones to school Zs because ZF a student Zs Zn trouble or someone Zs trying to fight them they can call their parents and get picked up. This would help the students and principals/staff Zn the school because they won't have to deal with the drama. Another reason Zs because many students need their phones for numbers or directions to places they need to be after school or ZF they are leaving during school. My last reason Zs that ZF a close family member Zn a student family has died the parents can call their child to tell them. Cell phones are very Important Zn students and parents lives. Now, ZF you have a child and something Important happened or something happened that you needed to know about and the teacher wouldn't let your child call you wouldn't, you be upset or worried? That's how many parents feel when they can't reach their child. Please consider this letter and think about how Important At Zs for a child to bring their cell phone to school. Thank you for your time Zn reading my letter.

"Cars have become a par too our modern day culture since the invention OO the first model. Many countries around the world have an abundance OO car buyers and users, however others are taking into consideration alternatives. The advantages OO limiting car usage include relief from stress OO cars upon individuals and reduced emissions in the environment.

Cars put north a lot of stressful trouble upon users. These vehicles are designed to transport a person or people from point A to point B, however cars are for personal use that can cost an immense amount OO money. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walter about her new ""Carrie"" lifestyle (Rosenthal,3). This ideology is spreading throughout all Europe as more alternate transportations are provided by the government. As Silky mentioned in Source 3, locations, such as parks and sports centers with uneven sidewalks, have been replaced with broad, smooth ones for citizen's use. Moreover, many cities have provided a bicycle program to promote less usage OO cars. These steps towards change help convince people that there are alternatives out there, and that we aren't limited to just buying a car and license to go to places.

Additionally, the limitation OO car usage help establish a better and healthier environment for everyone. Cars emulate lots OO dangerous gases that may harm our precious earth, many OO which are responsible for the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect causes gases to be trapped in the atmosphere which harms our ozone layer and creates a smoglike appearance on our cities. Paris is an example OO a polluted city as civilians battle against threatening smog from emissions OO diesel cars in France (Door,8). Many actions towards progressive behavior have increased the likelihood OO limited car usage, such as tolls throughout cities and lines up to $25 for violators OO laws. These enforcement will ensure that the environment is capable OO maintaining generation after generation at a stable pace.

To conclude, many countries are pondering choices OO opportunities to promote less usage OO cars, while some are on their way to solve these issues, limitations on car usage have a variety OO advantages for ourselves and the environment. These limits help reduce stressful situations, as well as provide a healthier ecosystem to live and prosper.

"When it comes to classrooms, having teachers design projects for students can be just as beneficial as having students come up with their own ideas. In my experience, having a teacherdesisned project save me a starting point to expanding my knowledge and learning. Instead of having to think of an idea from scratch, I had a framework to work off of – the challenge was figurines out ways to take that project and make it my own. Instead of feeling overwhelmed with the project, I could focus on understanding the concepts I was presented with, and use that knowledge to come up with my own creative solutions or ideas. 

Research has also sussested that when teachers structure and side learning, it leads to better academic outcomes for students. A study published in the International Journal of Research and Reviews in Applied Sciences showed that when students were given guidance, structure and support, their overall learning experience improved. Specifically, when teachers designed projects, students reported feeling more confident and comfortable in their learning environment. 

In conclusion, having teachers design projects provides many benefits for students that they wouldn’t experience if they were designing them on their own.

Limiting car usage has several important benefits for cities and citizens. One key advantage is improving air quality and reducing pollution. As passages 1 and 2 explain, vehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution problems in many urban areas. Cutting down on driving would help lower damaging emissions like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. This would have significant health effects, since air pollution is linked to respiratory illnesses and other health issues. With less traffic congestion, cities would experience cleaner and safer air. 

A second advantage discussed in passage 3 is promoting more sustainable transportation options. By driving less, people would be encouraged to take public transportation like buses and trains more often. This would support public transit systems while also reducing dependence on individual cars. Shifting modes of travel even partially away from cars to walking, biking or public options makes urban transportation more environmentally-friendly and sustainable for the long run. Cities invest in convenient and affordable alternative options, more people will feel able and willing to leave their cars parked when possible.

Finally, limiting car use would help alleviate traffic problems mentioned in all three passages. Major cities currently struggle with traffic jams, long commute times and a lack of available parking. Less individual driving would ease congestion on roads and highways. With fewer vehicles clogging up streets, the flow of traffic would improve significantly. This would have economic benefits too, by reducing time lost due to traffic for workers and transport. Emergency vehicles could also respond more quickly in emergencies. Overall urban livability and productivity would rise.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through individual choices and city policies offers clear environmental, health, transportation and economic advantages according to the provided sources. Transitioning away from automobile dependence would produce cleaner air, support sustainable options and alleviate traffic issues plaguing many cities. Citizens and communities would benefit greatly from reduced driving in urban areas.",1,limit car usag import benefit citi citizen key advantag improv air qualiti reduc pollut passag explain vehicl emiss major contributor air pollut problem urban area cut drive help lower damag emiss like carbon monoxid nitrogen oxid particul matter signific health effect air pollut link respiratori ill health issu traffic congest citi experi cleaner safer air second advantag discuss passag promot sustain transport option drive peopl encourag public transport like buse train support public transit reduc depend individu car shift mode travel partial away car walk bike public option make urban transport environment friend sustain long run citi invest conveni afford altern option peopl feel abl leav car park possibl final limit car use help allevi traffic problem mention passag major citi current struggl traffic jam long commut time lack avail park individu drive eas congest road highway fewer vehicl clog street flow traffic improv signific econom benefit reduc time lost traffic worker transport emerg vehicl respond quick emerg overal urban livabl product rise conclus limit car usag individu choic citi polici offer clear environment health transport econom advantag accord provid sourc transit away automobil depend produc cleaner air support sustain option allevi traffic issu plagu citi citizen communiti benefit great reduc drive urban area,204,204.0,0.0784313725490196,0.4362745098039216,0.16176470588235295
"Do you ever regret choices? Everyone does at some point but, asking others for their opinion can save you from butterflies in your stomach. Seeking out multiple opinions can help you by learning more about your options, seeing different outlooks from people, and helping you make better choices. Asking for help is never a bad thing, it helps you be more confident on your final decision.

You can receive different outlooks on your choices. Each person's opinion is different and asking multiple people can allow you to get a variety of responses on that topic. Different opinions can easily change your point of view. Some people can be more passionate with their opinions. That all matters on the person, some may give you a one word answer while others may go on and on. The more people you ask, the more ideas you get for your choice. This could be overwhelming which is why you want to take your time on understanding the different aspects of your choices and what people have said. There is no minimum or maximum of people you may want to ask, it's all up to you, but the more the merrier.

It's not possible to know everything about everything which is another reason asking others can help you make a better choice. People have more knowledge on certain things and they may know a lot about it. This may help you become more comfortable with your choices, and hearing it through a conversation could be more beneficial than researching about it. It depends on what decision you're trying to make but, people may have a first hand background or experience with it and you may never know if you didn't ask. You have a lot of knowledge in things you don't even realize. Some things are tucked away deep inside your brain. Thinking more into a certain thing can help wake up that part of your mind more. In the end, people know more than you might realize.

More opinions can help you have less stress in the end. Opinions can teach you a lesson of how you may think next time a problem comes up. It could end with being an easy good decision or a long thought good decision. You'll end up more certain. Whenever you are put up with a task, you want to make sure your decision is going to be the best for everyone, not just yourself. You can gain a stronger personal opinion that can back you up in the future. You may disagree with everyone or you may agree with everyone, gaining the skill to agree and disagree is a strong thing to do! Stress is common and asking for people's opinions may just lower the amount you have.

Asking others for their opinion is a easy way to make better choices. Whether its learning something new, or having stronger mental health, asking is benefical in every way.",0,regret choic point ask opinion save butterfli stomach seek multipl opinion help learn option differ outlook peopl help make better choic ask help bad thing help confid final decis receiv differ outlook choic person opinion differ ask multipl peopl allow varieti respons topic differ opinion easili chang point view peopl passion opinion matter person word answer peopl ask idea choic overwhelm want time understand differ aspect choic peopl said minimum maximum peopl want ask merrier possibl know reason ask help make better choic peopl knowledg certain thing know lot help comfort choic hear convers benefici research depend decis tri make peopl hand background experi know ask lot knowledg thing realiz thing tuck away deep insid brain think certain thing help wake mind end peopl know realiz opinion help stress end opinion teach lesson think time problem come end easi good decis long thought good decis end certain task want make sure decis best gain stronger person opinion futur disagre agre gain skill agre disagre strong thing stress common ask peopl opinion lower ask opinion easi way make better choic learn new stronger mental health ask benef way,187,187.0,0.2620320855614973,0.45989304812834225,0.1443850267379679
"Students hate the fact they have to get UE for school. Some students can get work done better if it was quieter. They wouldn't be as stressed out from all the work they get they can go at their own Each. They would also be more dedicated to do there work. Students should take classes at home because they can be more comfortable at home and there would be fewer distractions.

When students take classes at home they can feel more comfortable. Students don't have to worry about getting UE so early in the morning to come to school when they get UE at a good time they had enough rest to be focused enough to do there work. Online classes can actually be better for the students because they move at their own Each even though there teacher might give them a do date, but they wouldn't be as rushed as they would be in an Public school. The students also can be more organized and keep UE with their work better. However, being at home can take stress off the students because they don't have to worry about rushing to class or getting involved in situations that they shouldn't be in. Some students concentrate more when they listen to music while they are doing there work, they can do whatever makes them feel more focused because they are at home. Video conferencing can held the student more because they are getting the teachers full attention and can get more held.

Online classes can make learning easier for the students because there would be fewer distractions around them. Being in a classroom full of other students can be difficult at times because of noises, constant talking, and bad influences, but being at home can be a little better because they can move away from the distractions. Students tend to get side track and the mind focuses on something else that's not important. They can get there work done more because they wouldn't be as talkative with other that will throw them off track. Consequently, students actions effect everything if they be around People that are bad influences they are going to fall into Ever Pressure and that can effect the students grades and schooling. Being at home taking classes can be less Ever Pressure for them that means better grades.

Finally, students taking online classes can be good for there mental health. The fewer distractions they get the more they will succeed. Being uncomfortable can be a bad thing for the student because there grades will fall, and they wouldn't be as focused as they need to be.

"Venus is going to take Earths stop?

Is Venus worth the risk to explore? maybe so. Venus has so many things to offer, evening star, many out of the world features, and a thick atmosphere. Doesn't mean we should kill ourselves trying, I think Venus is not worth the try.

First and foremost, the evening star, is the Brightest point in the sky. Venus also makes it simple to stargazing. Venus is the second planet and the next closest plant next to earth. Stargazing is all fun and games on earth, But if you go to Venus you may Turn.

Also, Venus has a very thick atmosphere. It's almost 97% carbon dioxide Blankets around Venus. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on planet earth.

Lastly, Venus's light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography ineffective. Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else in that matter. Many people are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last longer to contribute to our knowledge.

Venus should Xe left alone, just as we would want to Xe. Venus is a harm to all man kind who try and research on Venus.

"Improvisation versus following a script: which is the better way to become someone?

As a 8thgrade student, I have been actively seeking ways to improve myself and become the best version of myself. In my research, I have come across different methods of self improvement, such as improvisation and following a script. In this essay, I will compare and contrast these two methods and argue that improvisation is the better way to become someone.

Improvisation is the act of creating something on the spot, without a plan or script. It is a way of adapting to the situation and making the most of it. For example, when I was part of a school play, I had to improvise my lines when my fellow actor forgot their lines. At first, I was nervous and unsure of what to say, but with some practice, I was able to come up with something that fit the situation and made the scene more interesting.

Following a script, on the other hand, is a more structured approach to becoming someone. It involves following a set of instructions or rules to achieve a specific goal. For example, when I was learning how to ride a bike, I followed a set of instructions that told me how to balance, pedal, and steer. While following a script can be helpful in achieving a specific goal, it can also be limiting and inflexible.

In my personal experience, I have found that improvisation is the better way to become someone. When I was part of a school debate team, I had to improvise my arguments on the spot. At first, I was nervous and unsure of what to say, but with practice, I was able to come up with arguments that were relevant and persuasive. This experience taught me the importance of being adaptable and able to think on my feet.

Furthermore, improvisation allows for more creativity and individuality. When I was part of a school improve group, I was able to express myself in ways that I never thought possible. I was able to come up with unique and original ideas, which helped me to stand out and be myself. This experience taught me the importance of embracing my own unique qualities and expressing myself in my own way.

In conclusion, improvisation versus following a script are two different methods of semipro",1,improvis versus follow script better way thgrade student activ seek way improv best version research come differ method self improv improvis follow script essay compar contrast method argu improvis better way improvis act creat spot plan script way adapt situat make exampl school play improvis line fellow actor forgot line nervous unsur say practic abl come fit situat scene follow script hand structur approach involv follow set instruct rule achiev specif goal exampl learn ride bike follow set instruct told balanc pedal steer follow script help achiev specif goal limit inflex person experi improvis better way school debat team improvis argument spot nervous unsur say practic abl come argument relev persuas experi taught import adapt abl think feet furthermor improvis allow creativ individu school improv group abl express way thought possibl abl come uniqu origin idea help stand experi taught import embrac uniqu qualiti express way conclus improvis versus follow script differ method semipro,154,154.0,0.17532467532467533,0.487012987012987,0.09740259740259741
"As you may know, the Electoral College consists of 538 electors, which is an even number. As said in ""The defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing President,"" that even number can be a result of a tie in electoral votes, but is highly unlikely. But even then it is unfair to those who ""like"" the system, whereas I oppose the voting system. Like everyone, I have my reasons;1) 'Electoral college is a disaster factor' 2) Voters don't vote for the President, but the electors instead.

To begin with my first reason, that electoral college is disaster factor as said in' The indefensible of the Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' the system had a fiasco, as you may call it, back in the 2000 election was the biggest crisis in a century. Also in 1960, segregationist in Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing Democratic Electors with electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so that the popular vote wouldn't have gone to Kennedy. What else has opened in the 1960s? As you may or may not know, Vice President Richard Nixon, validated only his opponent's electors. With this, the Electoral College has flaws or loopholes making it a disaster factor.

As for my second reason, that the electoral college is unfair to voters. Electors may not always be faithful to their party, as said in' The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defense of the system are wrong' electors could vote for another candidate if they refused to vote for their party's candidate. Meaning that if a voter votes for a certain elector to vote for a certain President, then their votes probably wouldn't count. Also, because of the winner-takes-all system, candidates do not spend time in states that they are aware that they have no chance of winning them over, but focusing on the 'swing' states. For example, in the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see candidates at all and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't see a single campaign ad. Candidates shouldn't just avoid states that they have no chance in, but take that chance.

Even though the Electoral College is unfair and a disaster factor, it is also fair in the state department. Smaller states votes area as equal as a bigger states votes, and the electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-reagional appeal which makes sure that a candidate doesn't just go to a region that he knows he will get votes from, but to others that will allow him to gain more voters.

So in conclusion to my knowledge, the Electoral College voting system should be changed for so that the system wouldn't be dysfunctional and unfair to voters. Which will make electing a president functional and fair to voters.

"Technology has had a significant impact on people's lives in recent years, and the positive effects are undeniable. From online books to video chat, technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and interact with the world around us. In this essay, I will explore some positive effects of technology on people's lives, including its benefits for students.

One of the most significant positive effects of technology is the ability to access information quickly and easily. With the rise of online books and readers, people can now read books from anywhere, at any time, without the need for a physical copy. This has made reading more accessible and convenient for people, and has led to a rise in literacy rates. Additionally, technology has made it easier for people to learn new skills and knowledge through online courses and tutorials. This has opened up a world of opportunities for people who may not have had access to education before.

Another positive effect of technology is the ability to connect with others through video chat. With the rise of video conferencing platforms, people can now communicate with friends and family members from anywhere in the world, without the need for physical presence. This has made it easier for people to maintain relationships with loved ones who live far away, and has also made it easier for people to collaborate and work together, regardless of their location.

Finally, technology has the potential to bring about upgrades and improvements in the future. With advancements in technology, we can expect to see improvements in areas such as healthcare, transportation, and communication. For example, technology is being used to develop new medical treatments and procedures, which have the potential to save lives and improve people's quality of life. Similarly, advancements in transportation technology, such as self driving cars, could make our roads safer and more efficient.

In conclusion, technology has had a significant impact on people's lives, and the positive effects are undeniable. From online books to video chat, technology has revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and interact with the world around us. Additionally, technology has the potential to bring about upgrades and improvements in the future, which could lead to even more positive effects. While there are certainly some negative effects of technology, it is important to recognize the many benefits that it has brought to our lives.",1,technolog signific impact peopl live recent year posit effect undeni onlin book video chat technolog revolution way communic learn interact world essay explor posit effect technolog peopl live includ benefit student signific posit effect technolog abil access inform quick easili rise onlin book reader peopl read book time need physic copi read access conveni peopl led rise literaci rate addit technolog easier peopl learn new skill knowledg onlin cours tutori open world opportun peopl access educ posit effect technolog abil connect video chat rise video conferenc platform peopl communic friend famili member world need physic presenc easier peopl maintain relationship love live far away easier peopl collabor work regardless locat final technolog potenti bring upgrad improv futur advanc technolog expect improv area healthcar transport communic exampl technolog use develop new medic treatment procedur potenti save live improv peopl qualiti life similar advanc transport technolog self drive car make road safer effici conclus technolog signific impact peopl live posit effect undeni onlin book video chat technolog revolution way communic learn interact world addit technolog potenti bring upgrad improv futur lead posit effect certain negat effect technolog import recogn benefit brought live,190,190.0,0.08947368421052632,0.531578947368421,0.15789473684210525
"Students are often given projects they don't like, but if they design then they could be a lot more drawn to work on then. Because is break, students shouldn't be working on a project they don't enjoy, they could choose to do a project about something they like. Runner projects should be student designed, this would make the projects feel more personal.

If students could design their own projects they would be more motivated to work on then. I once was assigned a runner project about whales, a topic I'n not really interested in. I didn't really work on the project during break and waited until the last week of break to work on it and didn't really do NY best on it. If students choose to do their projects about a topic they are passionate about, they will be more motivated to learn more about the topic and work on the project.

Students should design a project they would feel confident doing. Everyone is different, and every student is interested in a different topic. My sister was assigned a project about cooking, that is something she enjoys a lot, she finished the project the sane day it was assigned. She already knew a lot about the topic, but she learned more while doing the project, and she felt confident doing it. Students could feel better doing a project about a topic they already know a little and want to learn more about.

The projects they would design would let then have fun and learn while doing the project. I usually have more fun doing projects about topics I like to learn about. I learn a lot more when I'n interested in what NY project is about. Usually people learn more when they are having fun because that makes then more interested in the topic. Because is runner break students should be given the chance to have fun instead of having to work on projects about topics they don't really care about.

Having students learn during their break is important, but break is meant to have fun and relax. A project students can have fun doing is what every student would choose. If we let students do more projects about subjects they are passionate about they will be a lot more interested in doing then and will learn a lot more.",0,student given project like design lot drawn work break student work project enjoy choos project like runner project student design make project feel person student design project motiv work assign runner project whale topic realli realli work project break wait week break work realli best student choos project topic passion motiv learn topic work project student design project feel confid differ student differ topic sister assign project cook enjoy lot finish project sane day assign knew lot topic learn project felt confid student feel better project topic know littl want learn project design let fun learn project usual fun project topic like learn learn lot project usual peopl learn fun make topic runner break student given chanc fun instead work project topic realli care student learn break import break meant fun relax project student fun student choos let student project subject passion lot learn lot,145,145.0,0.20689655172413793,0.6344827586206897,0.04827586206896552
"How does the Electoral College affect the selection of the presidency and is it a positive force? Many may answer ""No."" or ""I don't know."" to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say. While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its Certainty, its transregionality, and it lets ""the most thoughtful voters"" (Poster Source 3) decide the election.

Swing states let Candidates to Campaign where it really matters. Being a voter in a swing state means you have to have extra Close attention to the Campaigns and the Candidates, leaving you to be more thoughtful than voters in states that aren't swing states. And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive ""the most information and attention from the Candidates"" (Poster Source 2). Voters from these states at the end of the Campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future.

A successful president must be voted for across the regions of the United States to fulfill the wants and needs of its diverse people. While popular voting AAN be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region AAN't win an Campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, ""residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" (Poster Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests.

The use of the Electoral College allows for a more Certain winner over popular vote, therefore avoiding election Crisis. Although there was one ""fiasco"" in 2000, as Bradford Plume Calls it in Source 2, the Change of this happening is very small since ""even a very slight plurality in a state Creates a landslide eleAtoralvote victory in that state."" (Poster Source 3) For example, in 2012, Obama relieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he relieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.(Poster Source 3). A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more Close than the 11.7 percent that the Electoral College gives us.

While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unnecessary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its Certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.",0,elector colleg affect select presid posit forc answer know question heard say negat feel feel elector colleg use forc elect presid certainti transregion let thought voter poster sourc decid elect swing state let candid campaign realli matter voter swing state mean extra close attent campaign candid leav thought voter state swing state turn voter state definit receiv inform attent candid poster sourc voter state end campaign doubt inform voter nation right decid fate elect futur success presid vote region unit state fulfil want need divers peopl popular vote aan skew natur region prefer popul elector colleg ensur region aan win campaign presid win popular vote region appeal resid region like feel disenfranchis poster sourc presid best repres use elector colleg allow certain winner popular vote avoid elect crisi fiasco bradford plume sourc chang happen small slight plural state creat landslid eleatoralvot victori state poster sourc exampl obama reliev percent elector vote reliev percent popular vote poster sourc percent tie close percent elector colleg believ elector colleg outdat unnecessari use swing state transregion approv certainti popular vote prove best method select presid futur,182,182.0,0.13186813186813187,0.47802197802197804,0.13736263736263737
"Ugh! Have you ever been stuck in a tough decision? Were deciding your actions the toughest thing out of everything else? That's why seeking advice from others is helpful, and it has many benefits. Asking others about your problem can offer you others' point of view on your situation, it gives you multiple choices on what you're going to do, and it also allows you to have an idea on what you're going to do. As you can see, Advice can be very rewarding and useful when you get stuck in situations.

First, you can see others' point of view on your problem. Advice can allow you to see what other people would choose to do if they were placed in your spot. For example, If you were deciding whether to hang out with friends or complete your school assignments, you could ask a friend. They would probably state what they would choose, and back it up with reasons why they chose what they chose. You would receive advice and why you should choose that option. One opinion can Heep you choose what you'd Like to do or say. Although seeking more than just one can give you more choices and options.

Seconded, it gives you multiple options and often gives you an idea on what you're going to go with. To me, its Like a video game. For instance, Gets say you are batting a fine boss, the game Gets you choose what to do next. If you have one opinion that's your own, You'EE one have that one choice and would have to go along with it because you didn't receive any other opinions from others. If you do explore others' thinking, you'EE have more options to defeat that fine boss.

Finally, After receiving AEE those ideas on what others would do if they were placed in your shoes, you can get your own idea on what to do. If you didn't Like what they had to say if it was their decision, you can combine multiple opinions to produce your own to choose in your battle of choice.

Its Like a math equation! If you have three plus bank is equal to six, you need that one number to complete the expression. The three represents your opinion and the bank represents someone else's opinion, When you get theirs, it's complete! You have an idea of what to do.

AEE in AEE, I think advice is a good thing. It can Heep out in any sort of problem you're stuck in. It is useful and again, it comes with many great outcomes. No more ugh!

When you get advice, it turns into a whew Hui!

You aren't stuck in a tough decision anymore! And you owe it AEE to asking for advice from friends and family. If you're ever stuck in a tough decision, I suggest asking for advice. ",0,ugh stuck tough decis decid action toughest thing seek advic help benefit ask problem offer point view situat multipl choic allow idea advic reward use stuck situat point view problem advic allow peopl choos place spot exampl decid hang friend complet school assign ask friend probabl state choos reason chose chose receiv advic choos option opinion heep choos like say seek choic option second multipl option idea like video game instanc say bat fine boss game choos opinion choic receiv opinion explor think option defeat fine boss final receiv aee idea place shoe idea like say decis combin multipl opinion produc choos battl choic like math equat plus bank equal need number complet express repres opinion bank repres opinion complet idea aee aee think advic good thing heep sort problem stuck use come great outcom ugh advic turn whew hui stuck tough decis anymor owe aee ask advic friend famili stuck tough decis suggest ask advic,156,156.0,0.16025641025641027,0.4807692307692308,0.16025641025641027
"In this article the author is supporting his idea about the studies of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In the article the author gives reason and evidence why. There is a possibility to live on Venus, but still too dangerous.

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it may well once been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4 it says ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" There is even a possibility that Venus was largely covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life just like Earth. Venus can be a possibility of Earth travels. The dangers of Venus are the 97% carbon dioxide on the planet. In paragraph 3 it says"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Venus atmosphere is more dangerous than ours, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in our on planet. Fan Venus be a planet we live on?

To get an understatement of Venus NASA need to get close and personal despite the risk.

"" NASA is working on different approaches. One example they gave in the article is some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This has been tested in a chamber simulating on Venus surface, and lasted three weeks.

Our travels shouldn't be limited by the dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation, like the author says in paragraph 8.

"What is a normal day TW you? Waking up, brushing your teeth, eating, then getting into car TW GW TW work, right? That last object in that list, getting into your car, puts a strain in the environment, commonly known as pollution. Tlthwugh the amount WF strain that an individual may put in the environment is miniscule, the combined output WF all cars in a city may be enough TW damage your lungs! In Beijing, China, people wear masks outside TW prevent inhalation WF the dense smog surrounding the city. This has led TW the development WF the ""smart planning"" movement, in which city planners build dense suburbs in which cars are unneeded. Ships are a walkaway, and your neighbor lives five minutes from your home. You may be asking ""Why DW I care about this? I own't have heavy smog in my city."" Well when car use starts TW increase in your city, that will affect both your health, and your happiness.

First off, limiting car usage will make you happier. ""How will this make me happy?"" Think about this, you GW through your usual morning routine, and you only have five minutes TW get TW work. That's perfectly fine because, gawd news, your job is a three-minute walk from your house! This drastically reduces stress as said in this quite from ""In German Suburb, Life Goes in Without Cars."" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother WF two, as she walked verdant streets where the swish WF bicycles and the chatter WF wandering children drawn but the occasional distant motor."" Secondly, the smog from cities with high car usage is becoming unbearable. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals... Last week Paris had 147 micrograms WF particulate matter PM per cubic meter compared TW 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" In Paris, after a few days WF ""rerecord pollution,"" enforced a partial, temporary driving ban. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered TW leave their cars at home WR suffer a 22eurw fine 31. The same would apply TW numbered plates the following day."" The congestion levels WF Paris were down by an astonishing sixty percent after five days WF the smog. Imagine that, in five days smog levels reduced by sixty percent. Imagine what the while world could DW if everyone pitched in TW this trend. ""Tutwmwbiles, experts say, is a huge impediment TW current efforts TW drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes.... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent WF greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up TW 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Lastly, a reduction WF car use can vastly improve the economy. In Bogota, Columbia, the local government have begun TW enforce a ""Day Without Cars"" in an effort TW curb rising pollution levels. This has been happening for three years, and has increased profits for small ships and eateries in the area. Because WF the large number WF walkers and bikers, ships were able TW make a larger profit with walking that just happened TW pass by the store. This is what caused more stores TW when up, thus blasting the local economy. Even businessmen are enjoying these days as stated by Carlos torture Plaza. ""It's a gawd opportunity TW take away stress and lower air pollution."" TW end this off, cars use can be greatly reduced. It is a matter WF willpower, which everyone has, but some are two lazy TW tap into it. The reduction WF car use will have long term effects in both you and the globe.

"Many people believe the face on Mars is an extraterrestrial being. Although it may seem true, the face is a natural landform. There are many facts to show this is a natural landform.

Many scientists have seen this face as life on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists have said there is life on Mars, and NASA is trying to hide it from the people. In 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the face, but they revealed there was no face to be seen. There was only a natural landform. Scientists have begun to lose hope of ever seeing the face again. If they were ever able to find the face again, they would have money to do more investigation. Although there were no extraterrestrial beings, people still believed the face would soon appear again. Scientists are still trying to look for ways to explain it all.

Researchers are still looking for the face on Mars. Scientist Jim Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes and the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were !"" He is comparing airplanes, pyramids, and small shacks to the face which is no longer there. This statement proves that the face is a natural landform. Many landforms on Earth form then after years or even decades, they decay down to nothing. Although landforms are always forming, they are also being destroyed. Without oxygen on Mars, there is no way the face is able to survive.

Although the face is not real and is a natural landform, researchers will stop at nothing to prove it is real. Conspiracy theorists are still trying to find the truth.

"Dear principal,

I heard you are considering changing the schools' policy so that the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think that's crazy! If AIDS don't have and opportunity to play a sport because of their ""C"" that's no reason to age away their dream. What if they want to become a professional swimmer? You're just going cut down their dream tree just because of a ""c'?

I have a ""C"" in math, and swim is coming up you're just going to age away my chances to beat my times from last year? I could grow up and become something amazing and than you one day for the opportunity of being able to swim, but now you have taken my and other swimmers ""the ride away"". Furthermore, I am appalled.

Furthermore, I now if you do intend to proceed in changing the policy we students will try to get better grades to play the sport, but not every GID has a GPA of 4.0. So their for I propose my idea to keep the policy that you just have to have a 2.0! Seriously, as my 6th grade teacher told me, ""something is better than nothing"". Sure you want us to have good grades but us AIDS, (teens) want to be involved in school activities but with or without good grades i think if they strive hard enough they deserve the right to be involved.

Than you for you're time I hope you rethink about changing the schools' policy so that students MAY participate in sports and other activities even if we have a ""C"" average. I'm sure i'm not the only student that would life to propose this statement.

This can be Particularly valuable for students who are interested in Pursuing careers in global fields such as business, technology, or science.

Thirdly, online learning can held students develop important skills such as self-discipline, time management, and communication. These skills are essential for success in any field, and can be Particularly valuable for students who Plan to Pursue careers in leadership or entrepreneurship.

However, there are also some disadvantages to online learning. For example, students may miss out on the social interaction and support that comes with traditional classroom learning.

"Using a Phone While Driving

In the United States the number one leading cause of car accidents are caused by distracted drivers who are on their cell phones. Texting while driving has caused over 3,000 teen traffic fatalities a year. When driving it is very easy to get distracted by devices such as phones, even those who think they are more experienced get into car accidents because of texting while driving.

Society nowadays is more dependent on their devices due to the inconvenience of not knowing what is going on in their daily life. Not to mention the development of technology has been implemented on the teens of the 21st century, causing more people to find social connections through devices rather than interactions. The concern has become a negative impact to the point people are placing a person's well being, in the same comparison to one of a broken phone. The effect a device has is also impacting the mental well being of the youth, in a recent study found between the years of 2010-2015 the suicide rate on females rose to 65% while the depression rate rose by 58%. This addiction to phones has also been carried out into areas such as in cars.

According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. The concern about using phones while driving impacts the lives of not only themselves but also puts the lives of others at risk. Cars have become more developed over the ages to cater the needs of those who need to call by installing a bluetooth, so drivers will not open and check their phone while driving. In the past driving was in the concern of ""keeping your eye on the road"" but as time went by so did the sensibility of driving.

Phones have now become a priority even when on the road and the lack of common sense is lacking more and more over time.

Whatever reason, people have become more adapted to checking their phones while driving, thinking that 3 seconds of simply ""checking"" ,wouldn't change anything. The awareness of people driving and texting or using their phones is not impacting enough to the public. Teens are learning these bad habits and becoming accustomed to do such actions without thinking of the consequences. Thinking of how society is progressing, situations like teen accidents will not change unless the awareness of it is made more serious. In some states' they are taking the first actions to prevent accidents by adding in laws that prohibit phones to be in a driver's hand. There is nothing more serious than being able to impact someone's life by taking a brief moment to check your phone while on being in the driver seat.

In conclusion, driving is a serious matter that should be taken seriously and not as a joke. There is no greater good than taking the moment to concentrate on what is in front of you rather than what is next to you. Take caution in driving and keep both hands on the wheel to prevent anymore suffering and any harmful casualties from devices.

"As an eigntngrade student, I believe that it is essential to commit to a career at a young age. While some people may argue that it is too early to make such a decision, I believe that TNE benefits of doing so far outweigh TNE risks. In this essay, I will discuss TNE benefits of committing to a career at a young age and provide creative strategies for expressing oneself through a career.

Cne of TNE main benefits of committing to a career at a young age is that it allows individuals to focus their efforts on their goals. When people are unsure about their career path, they may find themselves wandering aimlessly, trying different things without a clear direction. This can lead to wasted time and resources, as well as a lack of fulfillment in their work. By committing to a career at a young age, individuals can focus their efforts on gaining TNE skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in that field, rather than wasting time on unrelated pursuits.

Another benefit of committing to a career at a young age is that it allows individuals to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Many careers require individuals to take on internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of training early on in their career. By committing to a career at a young age, individuals can take advantage of these opportunities and gain valuable experience in their field. This experience can help them stand out to potential employers and increase their chances of success in their career.

In addition to TNE practical benefits of committing to a career at a young age, their are also creative strategies for expressing oneself through a career. Cne way to do this is to find a career that aligns wit none's passions and interests. When people are passionate about their work, they are more likely to be creative and expressive in their approach. For example, if someone is passionate about music, they may be able to express themselves creatively through their music career.

Another way to express oneself through a career is to find a career that allows for creativity and innovation. Many careers, such as graphic design or software development, require individuals to think outside TNE box and come up with new and innovative solutions to problems. This can be a great way to express oneself and make a difference in TNE world.

In conclusion, I believe that committing to a career at a young age NAS many benefits.",1,eigntngrad student believ essenti commit career young age peopl argu earli make decis believ tne benefit far outweigh tne risk essay discuss tne benefit commit career young age provid creativ strategi express oneself career cne tne main benefit commit career young age allow individu focus effort goal peopl unsur career path wander aimless tri differ thing clear direct lead wast time resourc lack fulfil work commit career young age individu focus effort gain tne skill knowledg necessari succeed field wast time unrel pursuit benefit commit career young age allow individu advantag opportun aris career requir individu internship apprenticeship form train earli career commit career young age individu advantag opportun gain valuabl experi field experi help stand potenti employ increas chanc success career addit tne practic benefit commit career young age creativ strategi express oneself career cne way career align wit passion peopl passion work like creativ express approach exampl passion music abl express creativ music career way express oneself career career allow creativ innov career graphic design softwar develop requir individu think outsid tne box come new innov solut problem great way express oneself make differ tne world conclus believ commit career young age nas benefit,196,196.0,0.1683673469387755,0.5,0.12244897959183673
"Dear Senator,

The Electoral College was created many, many years ago in the Constitution by our founding fathers, and now it is finally its time to retire. The Electoral College should be taken away and replaced by election by popular vote, in order to determine the president of the United States. The Electoral college should be abolished, because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are not treated fairly in this process. The United States strives to be a place of freedom and equality, but we as a country can not achieve this goals with this proccess in place.

The United States of America, is all about people protecting their rights, but how can that be if citizens are not even allowed to represent themselves with thier own votes. According to the Office of the Federal Register's article,""What is the Electoral College?,""you help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" Which means that our votes just choose people to represent our state and vote for us. So whats the whole point of voting in the first place? Is it just to make citizens feel like they are actually choosing the president. This proccess would not be a problem if the electors actually represented us correctly. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College:Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" by Bradford Plumer, ""in 2000...Al Gore... won the popular vote but lost the presidencey,"" because of the electoral college. Plumer went on to quote a Gallop poll recorded after Al Gore lost which reported,"" over 60 percent of voters would perfer a direct election to kind we have now."" Thats over half of the people voting! But the incident with Al Gore was not the only one, also according to Bradford Plumer's article,"" in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" In other words, they were trying to cheat and make sure the out come of the vote was what they wanted. People may argue that there have only been few instances of the Electoral College making mistakes, but how many more mistakes are they going to make in the future. Will there be so many, that our entire political system becomes corrupt. The citizens of the United States should be allowed to represent themselves with their own vote, and choose their own leaders.

How can the U.S. strive for equality, if states are not treated fairly through the process of the electoral college? The Electoral College process, is a winner-takes-all system, because of this, candidates spend their time only focused on specific states. States that are most populated, or that they think will be a ""swing"" state, basically any state that has a specific insterest to them and that will help their campaign. According to,""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" written by Bradford Plumer,""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This is a result of the faulty system, how are people suppossed to know who they want to vote for, if candidates won't even take the time to make a pitch to them? If the United States really wants equality, they need to start by having a equal state voting process.

At the end of it all, the Electoral College should be abolished because citizens are not correctly represented, and states are treated unfairly in the process. Help the United States continue to reach its goal of freedom and equality by abolishing the Electoral College.

Sincerely,

United States Citizen.

"Seeking multiple opinions when making an important decision or asking for advice can greatly help someone make a better, Be Informed choice. Getting different perspectives allows one to took at the situation from various angles and consider more options than if they had only consulted one person. 

People often view topics or problems through their own unique ones based on their experiences, beliefs and biases. No single person woo have a complete or perfectly objective view. By speaking to more than one person about an issue, it increases the chances of obtaining a wider range of ideas, insights and potential solutions. Others may notice factors that the advice seeker themselves has overlooked. Consulting several trusted individuals expands one's knowledge of an issue.

Another benefit is that getting a consensus across opinions builds confidence in the decision. If most people give similar advice, it reassures the person that a particular choice seems like the most sensible one based on how others see the situation. However, if the viewpoints differ significantly, it alerts the advice seeker that they need to carefully weigh AOO perspectives themselves to determine what woo truly be the best path forward given their own circumstances and priorities. 

Seeking multiple opinions also helps prevent acting on just one potentially flawed perception. Someone's advice could be skewed if they are biased, misinformed or do not have AOO the necessary facts about the situation. GettingVaoidation from others mitigates the chances of bad advice leading to a misguided choice. It encourages taking a prudent, multifaceted approach rather than a hastily made decision based just on a single source that may not have considered AOO angles. 

In summary, making important decisions based on input from various trusted individuals allows one to make a choice informed by a railroaded understanding of the issue. It reduces risks and increases confidence that the selection woo be in one's best interests overall.

"Hey there!  So, uh, essay time! 

Okay, so, you know how people always say that having a positive attitude and being humble is important for success in life?  Yeah, I know, it's like, super cliché. But, like, hear me out, k? 

So, I think it's pretty obvious that having a positive attitude can take you far in life. I mean, think about it. Mhen you're positive and optimistic, you're more likely to take risks and try new things. You're more likely to see the good in people and situations, and you're more likely to bounce back from setbacks.  It's like, the whole ""Attitude is everything"" thing, you know? 

But, like, here's the thing. It's not just about being positive all the time. It's also about being humble.  I mean, it's easy to get caught up in our own successes and think that we're, like, the best thing since sliced bread. But, like, no one likes a showoff.  And, honestly, if you're too full of yourself, you're going to have a hard time learning from others and growing as a person. 

So, like, how do you balance being positive and humble?  I think it's all about being aware of your own limitations and being willing to learn from others. It's about being grateful for what you have and recognizing that you're not better than anyone else just because you're successful.  And, like, it's okay to admit when you're wrong or when you don't know something. 

Now, I know some people might say that being humble means being a doormat or letting people walk all over you. But, like, no!  Being humble doesn't mean you can't stand up for yourself or set boundaries.

"Have you ever had to miss School? Whether you were sick, missed the bus, overslept, gotten injured, or you just couldn't make it to class. Whatever the reason missing class is not good and a lot of students miss class often. When students miss class it can cause them to fall behind and miss important material that they might need for later classes or tests. Missing class also means that you will then have to make up everything you missed and that can cause a lot of stress not only for students but for teachers as well. Distance learning will solve a variety of these problems and I believe that students will benefit greatly from it. By giving the students the opportunity to access the class online or by video conference you are helping students keep up with their school work, teaching them accountability and responsibility, and relieving stress on students.

Distance learning will help students to not fall behind on their work or in class. It is very easy to fall behind when you miss school it can make students feel lost, confused, and unprepared. When students are absent they are likely to have to come in early, stay late, and schedule appointments with teachers. They are also forced to work around their teacher schedules as well as their own. Getting behind on work can be really frustrating it can make students feel overwhelmed and unmotivated. But if the materials they learned in class that day are made available at home it solves the problem. Then students won't have to worry about not getting the work or missing the class because it is available online, and they have access to it so, they wouldn't have any reason to fall behind.

Making the classes available at home benefits students and teachers by holding students accountable for the work as well as teaching them responsibility. Students will no longer be able to miss class and not be held responsible for the work because they have access to the material at home. This will hold students more accountable because there are no excuses and no reason to not do the work because they are no longer missing the class even if they are not there. Teachers will also be able to hold the students more accountable because even if they are absent they still have the tools to complete the work, but without the teacher physically being there the responsibility lies on the student. This will also help students not feel like they have all the responsibility without the proper materials, and they will be able to do the work on time and not miss anything.

Lastly, distance learning will relieve students of stress and help them to not be as worried about missing class. Being a student is very stressful and as a student there are a lot of things that you are responsible for and or feel obligated to do. Yeeping up with the work load is a big job and a job most students struggle with. Students have a hard time maintaining a balance and tend to become very stressed. Missing class is very stressful because when a student misses a class they then have to deal with all the things that go into trying to make up the work that they missed. If a student misses more than one class it is very easy for them to become overwhelmed and stressed. But with distance learning you are eliminating the stress of missing class because students will still be able to do the work. Therefore, you are relieving the stress.

Although some people may argue, distance learning is a great tool and something that all students could benefit from greatly. It makes life easier for not only students but everyone in the school program. It helps students keep up with the work, it promotes responsibility and holds students accountable, and makes life less stressful for students. Making classes available for students online is a great idea and I think all students should have the privilege of having distance learning.",0,miss school sick miss bus overslept gotten injur make class reason miss class good lot student miss class student miss class caus fall miss import materi need later class test miss class mean make miss caus lot stress student teacher distanc learn solv varieti problem believ student benefit great student opportun access class onlin video confer help student school work teach account respons reliev stress student distanc learn help student fall work class easi fall miss school make student feel lost confus unprepar student absent like come earli stay late schedul appoint teacher forc work teacher schedul work realli frustrat make student feel overwhelm unmotiv materi learn class day avail home solv problem student worri work miss class avail onlin access reason fall make class avail home benefit student teacher hold student account work teach respons student longer abl miss class held respons work access materi home hold student account excus reason work longer miss class teacher abl hold student account absent tool complet work teacher physic respons lie student help student feel like respons proper materi abl work time miss distanc learn reliev student stress help worri miss class student stress student lot thing respons feel oblig yeep work load big job job student struggl student hard time maintain balanc tend stress miss class stress student miss class deal thing tri make work miss student miss class easi overwhelm stress distanc learn elimin stress miss class student abl work reliev stress peopl argu distanc learn great tool student benefit great make life easier student school program help student work promot respons hold student account make life stress student make class avail student onlin great idea think student privileg distanc learn,281,281.0,0.1601423487544484,0.5871886120996441,0.08896797153024912
"In my opinion, the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education rather than building theaters and sports stadiums. While entertainment and sports are important aspects of our lives, they should not be prioritized over the basic needs of citizens.

Firstly, medical care is a fundamental necessity for everyone. Without proper medical care, people cannot lead healthy lives and may suffer from illnesses and diseases that could have been prevented or treated. The government should allocate more funds to improve the healthcare system, including building more hospitals, hiring more doctors and nurses, and providing better medical equipment. This would not only benefit individuals but also improve the overall health of the population, which in turn would boost the economy.

Secondly, education is the key to a better future. It is the foundation of progress and development in any society. The government should invest in education, including building more schools, hiring more teachers, and providing better resources for students. This would not only benefit the current generation but also future generations, as education is a long-term investment that yields great returns. Education can also help reduce poverty and inequality in society, as it provides people with the skills and knowledge they need to improve their lives.

On the other hand, building theaters and sports stadiums may provide temporary entertainment, but they do not address the fundamental needs of citizens. While these facilities may provide jobs and boost the local economy, they do not have the same long-term benefits as medical care and education. Moreover, the cost of building and maintaining these facilities is often high, and the benefits may not justify the expense.

In conclusion, the government should prioritize spending on medical care and education over building theaters and sports stadiums. While entertainment and sports are important, they should not be prioritized over the basic needs of citizens. By investing in healthcare and education, the government can improve the lives of people and ensure a better future for society as a whole.

"Dear Principal, 

I'm writing to express my view sod the school's dew sports policy. As you know, the policy has had a significant impact OD our student body, myself included. I strongly believe that all students should be gave the opportunity to participate ID the sports they wish to take part ID, do matter their interests or abilities. Not only does this provide students with a unheeded outlet for Creative expression but it also encourages physical activity add healthy Competition.

Unfortunately, there are some students who have was severely impacted by this policy who are Dow turning to Criminal activities as a result. Although the policy states that students should be gave the opportunity to play their Hosed sport, made are dot being gave the same treatment. As a FodsequedFe, some students are dropping out, pursuing illicit activities, add ID some Cases becoming victims themselves. This is a disservice to these students as well as a huge source of disruption to the school. 

I believe that it is essential to provide all students with the Fade to participate ID the sports they are interested ID, as this Fad help foster a positive environment add reduce the Shades of Criminal activity. It is my hope that the school will reconsider its Furred policy add make adjustments to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to take part. Thank you for your time.

"A reason people should join the program is help countries recover supply of food, animals, and more. The text states,"" It was 1945, Word War VS was over in Europe, and many countries were Left in ruins."" The text also states,"" To help these countries recover their food supplies, animals, and more, 44 nations joined together to form UNRWA (the United Nations Review and Rehabilitation Administration).""

They should join together for the program to also help with families that have had relatives die in Word War VS. The text states,"" Luke Merger crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific Ocean twice to help people affected by Word War VS."" The text also states,"" Helping out aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for the dangers at sea. On his second, Luke served as a night watchman. His job was to check on AVV the animals every hour.""

Luke started helping them because he wanted to help people after Word War VS. The text states,"" Lurk Merger had no idea that his Life would change soon after his highschooV graduation. He was working two part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Last invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn't say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a Lifetime."" The text also states,"" UNRWA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of the horses, young cows, and moved that were shipped overseas. Luke and Don signed up.""

Luke helped shop 335 horses with hay and oats to Greece. The text states,"" In August 1945, they received their order to report to New Orleans. 'We arrived August 14,' Luke says, 'the day the Pacific war ended."" The text also states,"" They got their seaman's papers and boarded the SS Charles W. Wooster, headed for Greece with a cargo of 335 horses plus enough hay and oats to feed them.""

Another reason to help is because sometimes, you can see places you've never experienced before. The text states,"" The catboat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a smackdown boy,' he says. 'Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. But seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special,' he says."" The text also states,""' So was taking gondola ride in Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water.' Luke also toured an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.""

After that, he unloaded the animals and then had a Little fun. The text states,"" Luke also found time to have fun on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded. The cowboys played baseball and voVVeybaVV games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. TabVetennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games also helped pass the time."" The text also states,"" But being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more that an adventure for Luke Merger. It opened up the word to him. 'I'm grateful for the opportunity,' he says. 'It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs,' And that awareness stayed with him, Leading his family to host a number of international students and exchange visitors for many years.""",0,reason peopl join program help countri recov suppli food anim text state word war europ countri left ruin text state help countri recov food suppli anim nation join form unrwa unit nation review rehabilit administr join program help famili relat die word war text state luke merger cross atlant ocean time pacif ocean twice help peopl affect word war text state help aunt kati farm boy prepar luke hard work danger sea second luke serv night watchman job check avv anim hour luke start help want help peopl word war text state lurk merger idea life chang soon highschoov graduat work time job groceri store bank friend invit europ cattl boat luke say knew opportun lifetim text state unrwa hire seago cowboy care hors young cow ship oversea luke sign luke help shop hors hay oat greec text state august receiv order report new orlean arriv august luke say day pacif war end text state got seaman paper board charl wooster head greec cargo hors plus hay oat feed reason help place experienc text state catboat trip unbeliev opportun smackdown boy say help peopl benefit europ china acropoli greec special say text state gondola ride venic itali citi street water luke tour excav castl crete marvel panama canal way china unload anim littl fun text state luke time fun board especi return trip anim unload cowboy play basebal vovveybavv game hold anim hous tabvetenni tournament fenc box read whittl game help pass time text state seago cowboy adventur luke merger open word grate opportun say awar peopl countri need awar stay lead famili host number intern student exchang visitor year,270,270.0,0.10740740740740741,0.48518518518518516,0.07037037037037037
" In the article ""Making Mona Lost Sole"" by Canada, we learn of a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS for short. This system allows computers to detect and Identify human emotions based on facial expressions. Although this technology sounds like something straight out of a scoff move, OT's real and already On use today. In this essay, I well discuss whether using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students On a classroom Os valuable or not.

One of the benefits of using FACS On the classroom Os that OT could help teachers better understand their students. By being able to read their expressions, teachers would have a better odeum of whether their students understand the material. If a student Os confused, the teacher can quickly clarify the concept and help the student better understand. Another example that could be useful Os Of a student Os upset about something happening On their personal life. The teacher could then offer support or help to the student and refer them to the guidance office.

However, there are some downsides to using this technology. One of the biggest concerns Os privacy. Students may feel that their expressions are being Invaded and that they are not On control of their own emotions. This could lead to trust Issues between the students and teachers, as well as the school. Another concern Os accuracy. As cool as this technology sounds, OT's not always right. Sometimes, emotions can be misread or misunderstood. This could lead to wrong conclusions and misunderstandings.

In conclusion, the use of FACS On the classroom can be beneficial for both students and teachers. However, there are also concerns that need to be addressed before Implementing this technology. With that being said, I think that FACS Os a valuable tool that can help Improve our education system. It can help teachers become better educators, and On turn, help students become better learners.",1,articl make mona lost sole canada learn new technolog facial action code fac short allow comput detect identifi human emot base facial express technolog sound like straight scoff real use today essay discuss use technolog read emot express student classroom valuabl benefit use fac classroom help teacher better understand student abl read express teacher better odeum student understand materi student confus teacher quick clarifi concept help student better understand exampl use student upset happen person life teacher offer support help student refer guidanc offic downsid use technolog biggest concern privaci student feel express invad control emot lead trust issu student teacher school concern accuraci cool technolog sound right emot misread misunderstood lead wrong conclus misunderstand conclus use fac classroom benefici student teacher concern need address implement technolog said think fac valuabl tool help improv educ help teacher better educ turn help student better learner,144,144.0,0.16666666666666666,0.5277777777777778,0.1388888888888889
"If you are a student, and you have to do a runner project just know it's in the best interest of you from your teachers. I think that teachers should design the runner projects because students would make the projects to easy, the teacher would challenge what the students should know, and the teacher would design a project for the students that wasn't to hard nor to easy. In NY essay I will be talking about how I think that it's the right thing for teacher to design the runner projects.

First, if students had the choice to design their own project they would make it to easy. One tine NY friends and I were working on a group project and our teacher let us pick the project we wanted to do. We did the absolute bare minimum work that we had to do on the project. So our teacher gave us a harder project to do, and we did it and put in a lot of effort to it, and we actually learned stuff from the project that we did. This shows that if you get to pick your project you will try to get away with doing the littlest you can on something.

Secondly, the teacher would challenge what the students should have learned over the year. Another example I have is one tine when I was in English class I had to do a project on a book we read. I tried to pick an easy one a ND NY teacher wouldn't let né pick that one. She pushed né to thrive to be great and not lower myself and not to be something great in life. Therefore, this shows that if you try to not push yourself someone will try and push you to be the greatest thing you can be in life.

Finally, the teacher would pick a project that isn't to hard or to easy for you to actually do. One example I have of this is history class when I had to do something on the computer I picked a really hard project and NY teacher seen that I was struggling with it, so he gave né a new project that suited né better than the one I had before. This shows that if you pick something to hard that your teacher knows you can't do they will give you something easier.

In conclusion this essay shows that if you are a student your teacher should design your projects because students like to advantegdege of power that they have and pick something way easier. If you area student and you think you should design you projects you are wrong the teacher should design it.",0,student runner project know best teacher think teacher design runner project student make project easi teacher challeng student know teacher design project student hard easi essay talk think right thing teacher design runner project student choic design project make easi tine friend work group project teacher let pick project want absolut bare minimum work project teacher gave harder project lot effort actual learn stuff project pick project tri away littlest second teacher challeng student learn year exampl tine english class project book read tri pick easi teacher let pick push thrive great lower great life tri push tri push greatest thing life final teacher pick project hard easi actual exampl histori class comput pick realli hard project teacher seen struggl gave new project suit better pick hard teacher know easier conclus essay student teacher design project student like advantegdeg power pick way easier area student think design project wrong teacher design,151,151.0,0.16556291390728478,0.5231788079470199,0.19205298013245034
"Can you imagine a time in the Future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore ? Well no I can't really imagine a time in the Future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore. I can't imagine that because there's always going to be a time when you need to go somewhere & you're going to need transportation to get you there. IZ there were no cars in the Future so many lives would be so miserable because who would want to walk everywhere they need to go? I know I would get tired oz walking. There are so many places where people need to be on time but only with some kind oz transportation. Life wouldn't be so great without cars because just even walking the house or even to go down the street For something important would really get annoying & tired.

When reading paragraph 7 it talks about how BMW announced the development oz ''Traffic Jam Assistant in 2013. Well just because there were a lot oz ""Tragic Jams'' in 2013 doesn't mean just think about the Future without any cars. We need transportation everywhere we go. I know that there are many oz ways For transportation but walking, I don't think that's really a great idea knowing that we walk 24/7 365 days out oz the whole year. Having a car & knowing that you can drive it around anytime you would like to be actually good, because even though the gas that you put in your car goes up a dollar or 2 every week doesn't just give up or think about not having cars in the Future. There are teenagers all over the world that are looking Toward to getting them a car when they get older & even teens and adults now that are wishing that they could get them a car.

My position on driveless cars is that what is a driveless car IZ you still need a driver to drive the car ? You will always need someone to drive the car even IZ it is a driveless car. There are car crashes everywhere you go, but you can always Six that problem by sharing the road with the other drives. Watching out For other drivers and the people that are walking is a big step oz getting behind the wheel. Making sure that there aren't other people in the way so that you will not hit them & even Following the rules oz the road, like making sure that you stop at STOP signs & even waiting For your turn to turn while driving.

"Dear Principal,

Sports are a very important factor to many schools.

Any kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.

Our Principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

I fully agree and support this idea.

Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports, more students in the school would have grades of B's and even A's, and the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result.

Overall, a requirement of a B average to play sports would be beneficial to our school's community as a whole.

If a new rule is put into play requiring all students to have at least a B average to play sports, students with averages of C and below would be encouraged to bring their grade up.

For example, many of the athletes with averages below B would have a reason to bring their grade up, or else they won't be able to participate in the activity that they love.

All the athletes would change their priorities so that school comes first.

This rule would encourage students to do better in school so that they can participate in the activities that they love.

They would have a goal of achieving a B average, and applying themselves to achieve that goal. Overall, a requirement of a B average to participate in sports and other activities would be logical to put into play because it encourages students to do well in school and bring their grades up.

From this new rule, more students would have A and B averages as a result.

With a requirement of a B average to participate in extracurricular activities, more students would have the goal of achieving a B average.

As a result, fewer students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time.

With more students with a higher average, the school would look better in terms of grades.

Now that there is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.

As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.

This would make the school less known for its bad things, but more well-known for its high academic prestige.

This requirement would be the most reasonable choice because fewer students would be failing courses.

As a result of requiring a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports and other activities, the teams would be much smarter and more successful.

For example, the smarter students that earn a B average or even higher would use the knowledge that they learned in the classroom and apply it onto the field.

Instead of having sports teams that consisted of students who didn't make the right decisions and were failing out of their courses, the teams would consist of smart students who applied themselves to reach their goal of earning at least a B average in academics.

On the field, court, or rink, the sports team would be making much smarter plays, and ultimately becoming more successful.

The time has come to decide whether to make a requirement of a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities.

This requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom, more students would have a B or higher grade average, and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result.

So, Fr. Principal, go and make a requirement of a B or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities!",0,dear princip sport import factor school kid sport grant focus school work princip consid chang school polici student particip sport activ unless grade averag fulli agre support idea despit fact student grade averag new polici encourag student school particip sport student school grade sport team activ smarter success result overal requir averag play sport benefici school communiti new rule play requir student averag play sport student averag encourag bring grade exampl athlet averag reason bring grade abl particip activ love athlet chang prioriti school come rule encourag student better school particip activ love goal achiev averag appli achiev goal overal requir averag particip sport activ logic play encourag student school bring grade new rule student averag result requir averag particip extracurricular activ student goal achiev averag result fewer student fail cours lack effort time student higher averag school look better term grade requir averag particip sport music activ school smarter student result student sent better colleg make school known bad thing known high academ prestig requir reason choic fewer student fail cours result requir averag student order particip sport activ team smarter success exampl smarter student earn averag higher use knowledg learn classroom appli field instead sport team consist student make right decis fail cours team consist smart student appli reach goal earn averag academ field court rink sport team make smarter play ultim success time come decid make requir averag student order particip sport activ requir benefici school communiti encourag student classroom student higher grade averag sport team smarter success result princip make requir higher grade averag order particip sport activ,262,262.0,0.15648854961832062,0.5992366412213741,0.14122137404580154
"By do we Have Vice Present, Presidednt, ect.? It's because of our founding fathers. They decided that it would be easier if we Bad people controlling the world that we live in. They also came up with a system for this its called, Electoral College. this system Helps to decide who the President, Vice President, House of Representative sect, ... Each candidate running for President in each state Ba's Bis or BER own group of electors. You can choose your state's electors when you vote for a candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors.

After the Presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors. This certificate also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your states Certificate of ascertainment are sent to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, wBo in turn elect the present. Voters sometimes get really confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. Voters cannot always control who they are voting for but that is ok. the state decides who to pick the electors bats in first place. It's ok to make mistakes sometimes.

"Studying Venus is Certainly a Worthy Pursuit

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" hakes a compelling case that researching Venus is worthwhile even given the planet's hazardous environment. First, the details presented show that Venus holds any scientific mysteries waiting to be uncovered. Despite extreme heat and acid rain, its atmosphere and geological history could offer clues about how Earth and other terrestrial planets evolve over the. Learning more about Venus could thus advance scientific understanding well beyond just that one planet alone. 

Second, the article notes technology exists allowing for safe exploration of Venus from a distance or with short exposures. NASA's Parker Solar Probe recently withstood far more extreme temperatures than those on Venus, suggesting future probes could withstand conditions there even while sent directly into the atmosphere. The author also points out Russia has successfully sent several robots to Venus's surface, surviving far longer than expected. This evidence demonstrates exploring Venus directly is possible with the right engineering and materials.

In conclusion, the author hakes a strong case that studying Venus presents opportunities to answer fundamental scientific questions and advance technology in meaningful ways, merits that outweigh the inherent hazards. Detailing past successes and technological potential for withstanding Venus's climate, the case is persuasively had this planet holds knowledge worth braving its dangerous conditions to uncover. Overall, the evidence presented supports the idea that pursuing research on Venus remains a goal worth achieving.",1,studi venus certain worthi pursuit author challeng explor venus hake compel case research venus worthwhil given planet hazard environ present venus hold scientif mysteri wait uncov despit extrem heat acid rain atmospher geolog histori offer clue earth terrestri planet evolv learn venus advanc scientif understand planet second articl note technolog exist allow safe explor venus distanc short exposur nasa parker solar probe recent withstood far extrem temperatur venus suggest futur probe withstand condit sent direct atmospher author point russia success sent robot venus surfac surviv far longer expect evid demonstr explor venus direct possibl right engin materi conclus author hake strong case studi venus present opportun answer fundament scientif question advanc technolog meaning way merit outweigh inher hazard past success technolog potenti withstand venus climat case persuas planet hold knowledg worth brave danger condit uncov overal evid present support idea pursu research venus remain goal worth achiev,147,147.0,0.10884353741496598,0.3673469387755102,0.11564625850340136
"Cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, and their use in the classroom has been a topic of debate for many years. While some people argue that cell phones are a distraction in the classroom, others believe that they can be used for educational purposes. In this essay, I will argue that using cell phones in the classroom has several advantages that would benefit both students and teachers.

First and foremost, cell phones can be used to enhance student engagement in the classroom. Students are more likely to be interested in a lesson if it is interactive and engaging. By using cell phones, teachers can create interactive activities that allow students to use their devices to learn. For example, teachers can use apps to create quizzes or games that are related to the lesson. This not only makes the lesson more fun, but it also allows students to learn in a way that is more meaningful to them.

Secondly, cell phones can be used to facilitate communication between students and teachers. Teachers can use messaging apps to communicate with their students outside of the classroom. This can be helpful for students who need additional help or clarification on a concept. Additionally, teachers can use messaging apps to create online communities where students can collaborate and share ideas. This can be especially helpful for students who are working remotely or who have different schedules.

Finally, cell phones can be used to provide students with access to a wealth of information. Students can use their devices to research topics, read articles, and watch videos that are related to the lesson. This not only allows students to learn more about the subject, but it also allows them to develop critical thinking skills. By using their devices to find and evaluate information, students learn how to critically evaluate sources and make informed decisions.

An example of an educational setting in which the use of cell phones would be helpful is in a science class. Teachers can use apps to create interactive activities that allow students to explore scientific concepts in a hands-on way. For example, teachers can use apps that allow students to simulate experiments or that provide virtual labs. This not only allows students to learn about science in a fun and engaging way, but it also allows them to develop critical thinking skills.

In conclusion, the use of cell phones in the classroom has several advantages that would benefit both students and teachers. By using cell phones to enhance student engagement, facilitate communication, and provide access to information",1,cell phone integr daili live use classroom topic debat year peopl argu cell phone distract classroom believ use educ purpos essay argu use cell phone classroom advantag benefit student teacher foremost cell phone use enhanc student engag classroom student like lesson interact engag use cell phone teacher creat interact activ allow student use devic learn exampl teacher use app creat quizz game relat lesson make lesson fun allow student learn way meaning second cell phone use facilit communic student teacher teacher use messag app communic student outsid classroom help student need addit help clarif concept addit teacher use messag app creat onlin communiti student collabor share idea especi help student work remot differ schedul final cell phone use provid student access wealth inform student use devic research topic read articl watch video relat lesson allow student learn subject allow develop critic think skill use devic evalu inform student learn critic evalu sourc make inform decis exampl educ set use cell phone help scienc class teacher use app creat interact activ allow student explor scientif concept hand way exampl teacher use app allow student simul experi provid virtual lab allow student learn scienc fun engag way allow develop critic think skill conclus use cell phone classroom advantag benefit student teacher use cell phone enhanc student engag facilit communic provid access inform,220,220.0,0.19090909090909092,0.6227272727272727,0.06818181818181818
"My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. Being active or doing something all the time is good. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise.

I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active, and it makes them feel good including myself. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. Like a personal trainer or a coach.

Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If I am inactive for a long period of time I can get sick or really anybody if you have been lying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. That's why it's better to be active.

Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening outside your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle.

Finally, I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. You do accomplish more if you stay active, and you can beat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.",0,thought prompt think better activ activ time good help help peopl chore time make physic fit time lot good exercis like work help peopl especi famili peopl enjoy like activ make feel good includ stay inact long period time like peopl world peopl life activ play major role life like person trainer coach inact bad especi long time frustrat peopl everybodi work need assist inact long period time sick realli anybodi lie day bodi need movement type exercis better activ inact good necessari exampl watch movi movi theater jump run place kick situat bad happen outsid home better stay far away interven better stay idl final occas inact serv purpos accomplish stay activ beat goal life hard work stay idl,120,120.0,0.18333333333333332,0.4166666666666667,0.18333333333333332
"I kinda do agree with this problem. Tech can tell what's everyone Food is at the moment and I also agree on you can read on people faces if they are upset or something. Tech tells you how to handle your problem and tell you what you should do. But, face emotions can speak louder than words and that's true. Also when people take pics of each other, that show it all as well. There are zany ways that your emotions can be shown not just by phone and other Tech. People try to lie about there emotions and sometimes, that can lead to life risks. If that person really sad then and always upset, then that person light think something that you don't want to see. Over the years, people is scared to tell other people what they think or what they should do. Some people don't realized that other people can help that person that is going through something that they should be going through. Everyone should think about the bad stuff and always should think about the good things. Now that being said, computers can read other people emotions and I believe it should give the tips to forget about what's going on.",0,kinda agre problem tech tell food moment agre read peopl face upset tech tell handl problem tell face emot speak louder word true peopl pic zani way emot shown phone tech peopl tri lie emot lead life risk person realli sad upset person light think want year peopl scare tell peopl think peopl realiz peopl help person think bad stuff think good thing said comput read peopl emot believ tip forget,71,71.0,0.18309859154929578,0.49295774647887325,0.08450704225352113
"Transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions Rosenthal 34. Global warming is becoming more of an issue as time goes on, part of this problem is vehicles and their pollution they let off. People are getting more and more worried about this as temperatures continue to rise on Earth. They are trying to do something about it. One of the more popular suggestions to help solve the issue is to limit car usage. I know, it seems pretty bizarre due to the fact that some towns, such as my own, do not have everything citizens need within a walking distance. Genetically, ""stores are being placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway. Rosenthal 6"". It is thought that it will ""drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipe... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States Rosenthal 5"". People also are not putting forth an effort to help decrease the pollution by buying hybrids, instead they buy Diesels. Diesel gas has more pollutants than regular gasoline.

Safety is another reason to reduce car usage. Think about it, if pedestrians reduced their car usage by 50 percent the percentage of car accidents would also decrease. This could save many people's lives animals as well. Rosenthal said, ""Cities could become denser, and better for walking"", which also makes it safer. To go along with saving lives lets mention health. Americans are getting more and more unhealthy and overweight. It is a rising problem in our country. Many people die from it everyday obesity can be stopped. One way to lose weight and get in shape is exercise. Imagine how much better shape Americans would be in if we actually had to walk to the grocery store or McDonald's. It would make us think ""do we really need that?"". Those extra burned calories count, sitting in a car does not burn many calories.

Traffic jams are aggravating to most people, with the decreasing number of car owners time is being saved. There is less traffic. Andrew Silky studied carefree day in Bogotá, and he stated ""rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic28"", this means time is being saved and people are getting to their destinations faster. Another idea was said by Carlos Arturo Plaza ""it's a good opportunity to take away stress... Selsky 24"". Congestion stresses everyone out, whether running on time, running late or just taking a leisurely drive. It makes everyone stress. Congestion actually decreased 60 percent in Paris Duffer 14. Hadron Carter also said ""Chen I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Limiting car usage helps a number of problems throughout the globe, such as to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions, improve safety, and even improve your health Rosenthal 43. You may wonder what other ways are there for you transport to the places you need to go. You could walk, jog, hike, bike, skate, or take public transportation. There are so many options, and you have the opportunity to meet new people and exercise if you're having a busy day. America should try it out just for a day and see what it leads to.",0,transport second largest sourc america emiss rosenth global warm issu time goe problem vehicl pollut let peopl worri temperatur continu rise earth tri popular suggest help solv issu limit car usag know pretti bizarr fact town citizen need walk distanc genet store place walkaway main street mall distant highway rosenth thought drastic reduc greenhous gas emiss tailpip passeng car respons percent greenhous gas emiss europ percent area unit state rosenth peopl forth effort help decreas pollut buy hybrid instead buy diesel diesel gas pollut regular gasolin safeti reason reduc car usag think pedestrian reduc car usag percent percentag car accid decreas save peopl live anim rosenth said citi denser better walk make safer save live let mention health american unhealthi overweight rise problem countri peopl die everyday obes stop way lose weight shape exercis imagin better shape american actual walk groceri store mcdonald make think realli need extra burn calori count sit car burn calori traffic jam aggrav peopl decreas number car owner time save traffic andrew silki studi carefre day bogotá state rush hour restrict dramat cut traffic mean time save peopl destin faster idea said carlo arturo plaza good opportun away stress selski congest stress run time run late leisur drive make stress congest actual decreas percent pari duffer hadron carter said chen car tens happier way limit car usag help number problem globe save time conserv resourc lower emiss improv safeti improv health rosenth wonder way transport place need walk jog hike bike skate public transport option opportun meet new peopl exercis busi day america tri day lead,261,261.0,0.1417624521072797,0.3716475095785441,0.11877394636015326
"Larijuana legalization has been a very controversial topic in the recent past. Some people are for its legalization while others are against it. In my opinion, marijuana should be legalized. 

One reason for the legalization of marijuana is that it would reduce crime rates. Currently, there are many illegal activities associated with marijuana, and these activities lead to high crime rates. For example, there are drug dealers who sell marijuana illegally, and they often engage in other criminal activities such as robbery and murder. However, if marijuana was legalized, these illegal activities would decrease, and crime rates would go down.

Another reason why marijuana should be legalized is that it has medicinal benefits. Larijuana has been proven to help treat certain medical conditions such as chronic pain, anxiety, and depression. Legalizing marijuana would make it easier for people who need it for medicinal purposes to access it legally, without fear of getting arrested.

Furthermore, legalizing marijuana would boost the economy. The government could regulate and tax marijuana sales, which would bring in revenue. Additionally, legalizing marijuana would create new job opportunities in the industry.

On the other hand, some people argue against the legalization of marijuana, claiming that it is a gateway drug. They say that people who use marijuana are likely to move on to harder drugs. However, there is no scientific evidence to support this claim.

In conclusion, I believe that marijuana should be legalized. Legalizing marijuana would reduce crime rates, provide medical benefits, and boost the economy. While some people are against its legalization, their arguments are not valid. The benefits of legalizing marijuana outweigh the potential downsides.",1,larijuana legal controversi topic recent past peopl legal opinion marijuana legal reason legal marijuana reduc crime rate current illeg activ associ marijuana activ lead high crime rate exampl drug dealer sell marijuana illeg engag crimin activ robberi murder marijuana legal illeg activ decreas crime rate reason marijuana legal medicin benefit larijuana proven help treat certain medic condit chronic pain anxieti depress legal marijuana make easier peopl need medicin purpos access legal fear arrest furthermor legal marijuana boost economi govern regul tax marijuana sale bring revenu addit legal marijuana creat new job opportun industri hand peopl argu legal marijuana claim gateway drug say peopl use marijuana like harder drug scientif evid support claim conclus believ marijuana legal legal marijuana reduc crime rate provid medic benefit boost economi peopl legal argument valid benefit legal marijuana outweigh potenti downsid,136,136.0,0.09558823529411764,0.3161764705882353,0.16911764705882354
